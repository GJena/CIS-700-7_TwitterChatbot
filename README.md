## Homework 3

__Evaluate your chatbot.__ Here, you should show some qualitative examples as well as train and test loss. Furthermore, try to be creative and see if you can make a metric for how well your chatbot is doing.

- good qualitative examples
- bad qualitative examples
- train loss
- test loss
- our own metric
Since it is not task based, it is harder to evaluate, we cannot just use task completion metrics

__Identify issues__ with your chatbot and suggest possible solutions and future work.
