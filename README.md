## Homework 3

__Evaluate your chatbot.__ Here, you should show some qualitative examples as well as train and test loss. Furthermore, try to be creative and see if you can make a metric for how well your chatbot is doing.

- train loss
- test loss
- Our own metric
Since it is not task based, it is harder to evaluate, we cannot just use task completion metrics. 
A combination of metrics may be best to evaluate the general purpose bot. Some candidate metrics could be:
 - Distance in word2vec embedding
 - Confusion metrics: how often it returns ‘I don’t know’ or UNK?
 - Sentiment analysis on user answers
 
__Identify issues__ with your chatbot and suggest possible solutions and future work.
