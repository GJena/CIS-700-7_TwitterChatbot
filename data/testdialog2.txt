happy friday and enjoy the day off 😃
if people aren't allowed to change, then your egregious miscues at nyt disqualify you from commentary.
and the reason for this is?
wrong: hillary clinton brought it up...trump went w/it. i bet aft he leaves office we will find out a lot more abt obama
a worthwhile vote for neither for be a vote for a third party, more votes more chance of getting on the debate stage next time..

my parents didn't let me have a console, so im really bad at using them and didn't want one once i could buy my own.

now i have 10
have not yet frank, but will this morning!!!!!
a white male author yelled at me publicly for being upset by the shriver thing, which was not 1/1000000th as terrible as these other things,
what is obvious to me is that he has the characteristics of a strong leader n part of that is having a strong sense of self.
oh yes......you know trump very well. he is such a con artist and each day the media helps him out

if his story is "hillary invented birtherism and i'm the one who debunked it," that's an obvious lie, not unusual for trump. but.
i can't pick the cards twice, not that i would anyway after last week...
no you want to make their day smooth
it's not a lie about the terms of some business deal. it's about what he's done in our faces for years, what made him politically prominent.

give me a " sorry about that chief" lol
interesting history. author's premiss flawed. controlled by air power. submarine scenario is fantasy.
the equivalent of a drive by apology. could he have gotten off that stage faster? wow.
i think the press thinks that as long as he talks about them it's good for them. they're just like him.
he just crushed it... playing his cards right now
i've been beating my head against maya for 2.5 weeks now just trying to make basic modular walls... d: is calling me... :)

like where did that come from. i just references pablo picasso, petey pablo, pablo escobar and kanye west in 7 words.

this was me during season 1 and 2 ok
the corn man ? wtf 😭

how does his base take this? because they do not agree.
so exciting! we can't wait for you to experience 's food!
cause you're queen that's how 👑
proud that you will.
if journalists actually acted like journalists, trump wouldn't even be in this position. this election is a macabre circus
...repent of this sin you just committed
it's not a "news conference," it's the aristocrats!
exactly. it turned especially bad since the latest companion… it still had some charm before that.
that won't happened because gloria's question needs to be answered. it will come up.
because you're not a real journalist, you're a liberal shill. bigger problems and this is what you push. 🤔
. mine is , for remembering that kids can be loud and that's okay. 🌺
is that some kind of lawyer-imposed thing that you're required to do?

the future is now i assure you. watch the cnn edits in the irish doc "chavez: inside the coup"

that was my reaction as well. you don't care how long the car has been there. what matters is that it's forcing you into traffic
thank you hillary ! mom of 6 each pay heck i have to decide do i pay my light bill or buy groceries?

i got sick watching that lmao
of course you are not outrage. you are gushing.
fine now it's over no more of this crap
- this is the kind of nasty stuff that you people resort to- no wonder dt is your guy- -shameful &amp; blocked
truman's policies resulted in the deaths of millions. any yokel can play that game. see ya.
yes. less talk, more action. no substitute for experience.
oh and by the way. it was hillary clinton's fault i shit on your head. and you all owe me a big debt of gratitude for resolving this finally
... one i wanted just sold. why does this always happen with ship paintings?! next closest one: ebay
greatttt. u were in my dream last night, you came home and were sitting on the couch at grams because u were sick 😷
maybe in your simple mind, cruz and rubio have sharp minds.
i don't know if it's what people want, but what they expect. folks bristled at $40 price tag on the witness
hope it goes viral... this really showcases the mega talents of !
still not enough. the criticism cannot simply be of trump. it must be of the media system that is enabling this.
he had committed heinous thought crimes.
i am super happy with chase.

good foundations give out over 80% of the proceeds (ckinton's). corporations give out dividends to their shareholders.

r.a.cohen used confidential id's and pro hackers to target my family members for witness intimidation. 5 spring st 10012
they must really trust him based on the support he's getting. white people wanna choose who's best for black people. right
absolutely agree. in cali the quality of ed between districts was directly correlated w the socio-economic status of the area.
so the media should just run the hotel portion of the event...
sorry sana, i just found out about these guys and pizza this morning. did you know pizza was not invented in italy?!
this is not right bring it back on tv
this coming from a member of the tin foil hat club/, who until today, didn't think obama was a us citizen.
do i have to sleep in the dirt for three days? because i can't handle life without showering lol
i would run it by the millions of unemployed blacks first. or are the non deplorable too good for work?
this would be it:
the corrupt left is so mad at this deplorable tweet they are coming to get you with this chick.....
distraction. trump can apologize after you hillary, apologize for benghazi and your email scandals!
many. each of the eggs you ate was scrambled.
but i haaaaaate the sound of the regular drill like that high pitched shit omg it makes my whole body shiver
had the opportunity to iphone upgrade this am but 5th ave store is a mess rn and it's a worse deal than 400$ flat

oooh ok ok. thanks
not only that ppl wanted his shit more than the real louis. it's because he made things that urban ppl could wear.
oh cool. i’ve been using the built in tools in os x server for imaging our macs but we only have 26 so it works well.
before him louis didn't make ready wear.
release date coming soon

a5: we've only barely cooled down, but the campground is adding electric mattress pads to our glamping tents
lmao deadass... family members? 👀
but, why's he trending is the question?! i don't have the heart to look...
again! in psychology, it is called "projection or transferral". narcissists never take responsibility of their own crimes.
me neither. lol
r.a.cohen payed hackers to invade adt and vivint security sys and rashid's family gets death threats.
this country needs you to help mrs. clinton beat this guy. you are the only one who truly understands him. please!! she needs you.
has always been cool on ig, was so sweet when i met her at dragcon and meet and greet. i feel so bad for her.
right on. how all of a sudden he has a rifle....
she's stirring the pot again
if there are, i hope there will be a "skip ad" arrow to click on....
my partner this morning was like “uh that’s a classic.”
whoa, congrats—a year is a big deal! 😊 time to celebrate with some cake pops? 🍰

. absolutely.
what a joke👎👎👎
😳 i'm just trying to finesse like you 🙏🏾🙌🏾
you still don't get how this is more honest than hillary?
of course, obama was "immaculately conceived" and so are his conceptions. he's sinless.
do you want bears?! cuz that’s how you get bears!
i can't recall🚑
we love you, piper!
my grandma doesn’t even know her apple id password.
i don't mind a little, but it's like chinese fruitcake.
i love you victoria. and i'm watching you, goodreads.
why do you say that i am disparaging them. and since i don't mention race, why are you bringing it up?
i'm pretty sure there was something in that drink.... or that's his natural state of flop
since when did they stop chasing him?
they're playing call me maybe now!!!
trump could not have stated it more concisely and to the point means not a barb🇺🇸🇺🇸
my ghetto ass with all those damn trash bags 😭
hillary just couple days back was in bad shape, came back like a bull
my observation is: earlier than ny. brunch in ny is like 1pm or later, in la people get brunch at like 11.
copied someone else's tweet good job
trump's insistence on pursing every perceived slight would be disastrous in a world leader.
maybe he should join psp or police-pakistan :p
new quest flavor? 🤔
i missed the haslam article .where did it appear? he's been pretty quiet lately
- seems msm is playing ppl, but intelligent ppl never gave it a thought!
i was physically dead at drakes concert right until i heard his voice and i rose from the dead

what about "watch her flow" to next week?
: we can best remember those of us who serve, by voting for trump &amp; investgating hilarity clinton.
if obma truly at 50% approval rating its probably a wash. still, she's concerned about her base
pretty adjective means he's not really sure😃😃

wow of all people to defend trump. wow
it was great to be there. see you at 3
jeff was at ct long before i started reviewing there in 2008, and in fact got me intro'd there in the first place. you're in good hands!
plenty of moms have big jobs but family comes first.

the article called him a "liar" 4x.
yes it stings when someone 1 stars &amp; galleys aren't even out. it's not the same as a crowd trying to tank your career based on your race.

it's crazy. the later os 10 betas were much better than this.
facts, niggas must of forgot
there was no manhattan bound trains from the one station i was at
you're right... i was not ready for that.
nobody from clinton's 2008 campaign questioned obama's birth. nobody. there is no there there. another trump lie. add to the pile.
players continue to play out of position because he has no other tactic other than 4-4-2
i mean lost????
exactly, but you know they like to act like they created everything.
this is the worst
you have some really interesting constraints too :d really happy to be influencing

deflection , like i said , he shouldn't of thrown him under bus. could of went about it differently for sure

this was supposed to say "dedicated"!
has never once,not one time,ever told the truth in at least eight years.we are to believe he produced a legit certificate?

let's hope it doesn't take that long this time since they were aware in beta.
some americans don't care, those allowing themselves 2be misled by a huckster. hillary supporters must register &amp; vote for her
-curious, putin is into poisoning his enemies, and medvedev picks mushrooms on his lavish estate.

it's sad that all hillary has to talk about is trump. what does she have to offer america?
i won't either. but for me, hillary has helped kill millions in iraq, libya, syria, honduras &amp; yemen. i want no more of that.
and here's the real numbers, courtesy ; source:

does the oscar mayer wienermobile count? they don't actually make food.
it's cool he's just shufflin' every day
the best part
it's marketing-syndrome. managers want to push, product! product! product! they don't step back and ask "is this actually good?"
to be fair, msnbc is hammering him on the nirther stuff, so is cnn
and the wreck, for that matter
i am killing it
no, actually they didn't. they said that's what trump claims before debunking it by showing actual clips of dt in 2008
it's not an apology. it's a skeevy attack ("bernie's a no-show") disguised as a correction no one will see.
all the best for a great day -- and a wonderful new year to come, alexis! :) be well. regards thanks, lauren!

the fuck that got to do with revis? everything aint manning and brady
the sparrow is the leader of a cult. he acts pious, polite, etc, but always has violent fanatics with him.

never settle for less
i condemn all sects and you support every word of the koran. making you an extremist.
so using a theme from nra talking points about everyone needing to be armed will get pushed aside by the next awful thing.

thanks, jay! thought about it a bit, but don't have the editing skills! for now sticking to snapchat! :-)
will they be taken from yours?
it is hot weather therefore should not bother you much
also bribes using a real-money based currency
so jealous.
absolutely it was. trump was thoroughly dragged.
interesting, 4/4 even though it has that swing and weird stress pattern?
careful dude, you don't want to end up on the wrong end of it. clintons have long arms. :)
and slick willy ? come on keep on drinking kool-aid
disastrous we need donald j trump to step in instead of our weak president obama
i took this tagline differently: even for republicans, who nominated him.
you say that it was the blackberries &amp; i push you into the stream knowing i'll never see you again &amp; then i wander in that dream, in that

his immediate impact was to add heart and soul...he and lafontaine could have been the second cup generation
lmao 😂😂 this ass?
glad to be here for u
so there is no gatekeeping. if there's demand for some content and you refuse to make it, someone else will.
hey, blame it on the rain, man
exception is non-market media: nonprofits and vanity projects w/ rich backers. but money can only make these exist, it can't force audience.
drug dealers make similar defenses of their roles too.
kdlang was phenomenal. what a voice !!😍
you didn't see invictus? not a bad flick.
so incredibly gorgeous and such a great actor. not to mention his charitable foundation.
i agree, but i think it may be time to focus on your positives over his negatives
(which i've seen approx. 1.56 bamillion-jillion times, but, c'mon - it's a classic.)
it's not given enough credit as a factor of a winning &amp; championship organization.

very happy with the person you are 💞
yeah but you'd make that paper in montana funny as hell.
ah you meant salem, yes, agreed. even when it doesn't work the visuals and yes even audio shit is interesting

i just liked the way everything wraps up neatly, and the earth can go back to the beetles at the end.
most of the philanthropic money in that area is very ideological -- not always useless, but i'd prefer a newsier approach.
yea he does but he's going to rejuvenate that in the next day with a plate of rice and beans
so did you get it? how is it?

that's exactly what i told my mom 😂
the blacked out pc group just had an intense ending to their pong game and tossed a pitcher of beer everywhere. ....youths
these must be the stories that have pissed off trump tonight. he's such a thin-skinned baby.
or maybe he has a fetish and he likes it when they pull his beard
if man doesn't think of putting condom on, then the chances are that drunk sex will occur w/out a condom.

how do you not realize that? trump generated record free publicity.
nik was just saying how your mom would love it
it was fun right? they made it seem like it was based on a true story.
not because his message was wholesome?
i've had offices in both but, i am partial to its sister, the inland steel building:

don't be an asshole, people are injured. both incidents are upsetting.
yes,he has shown his liking for putin and other dictators.besides i am not working for you.
fair play because you did yet i completely overlooked it. it's a lesson for me to pay attention to the details, not the drama.
i am omitting the time when lady narborough simply sits as it is beneath mention, do not at me.
i'll try it
didn't even report on this explosion earlier! i heard about it from . mike, please keep reporting because no one else will!
pricey. but easy to visit. great beach, excellent brunch.
one "e" sounds way better😂😂
at this point, it's clear that's what the authorities think. it's not idle speculation.
when has that ever happened to you
i'm still a little hazy on this twitter thing, but is it possible to dislike a tweet? like, a broken heart icon i can click?

this was back in the flintstones era. they used pterodactyls for airplane engines. hehehehe
apparently i care more about the well being of the victims of tonight than you.
kasich has profoundly disappointed me. the defacto endorsement of obama here is outrageous. a far smaller man than i once believed

this is true! wasn't reporting on the explosion earlier. it happened in manhattan neighborhood i know well.
*peter daou, staring his i-have-killed stare at a woman* someday love will find you...
you are fired!!
or maybe the money his wife took from the university she didn't manage properly. i am not sure, just saying. everyone has faults
if u truly trusted bernie i dont' know why you don't any more. what happened
to be fair, the area is near several high-profile comedy venues.
honestly in this political climate, that doesn't seem so far fetched. the stakes are high.
black people shouldn't be fooled by hillary clinton google it...get educated about her

so widely distribute a product that doesn't represent your true values, then tell them about your "real" passion?
don't tell that to the media. they love to portray the mood as one of absolute chaos &amp; hell breaking loose.

a transformer exploded? what triggered it?
oooooops wacky shenanigans
a new device found 4 blocks away from the original explosion in chelsea-still no idea who did this intentional act
i've heard good things but don't have any queer friends to go with @ this stage so let's do it sometimes
not only that
needless to say
trump's trigger finger is itching for that nuclear button - so what if its itchy without even knowing what's happened yet
can i come 👊🏽 round 2 lol jk
but this is still a major dining faux pas ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
thanks 😊 i'll actually be in san fran and then oakland tomorrow and monday
wow, mics spread out as oppose to being altogether. btw, those nypd logos aren't mics.
obviously these people are not the least bit interested in facts and believe every lie trump utters, tho repeatedly debunked.
islam has been a threat long before those groups existed. smear tactics fail.
now you cover the story?
it probably means that they know something, but that they are not saying.

it's not the same for us as it is for officials. what they say has consequences, as we've seen over the last 15 years.
i kept hearing in media a "terror attack" would help him get elected. someone may have acted to help him!

bc it's run by two democrats the governor and mayor. since hilliary won't say terrorist they won't.
on what medium?!?!? isn't it an in person game?
de blasio said there was no terrorist connection, thats denial
oh the bomb squad is checking it out. hilliary don't want the word bomb used,squad is checking it out correction

his message is getting lost, it's just a distraction &amp; sooner or later the club will be split, he doesn't care about that.
lived here all of my pre-college life and i've never seen "santa clara" and "lit" in the same sentence

jk he's awake, he was getting free frozen yogurt 😂
i can't believe it. ariel &amp; i weren't too far from the area. glad your okay.
idk what to say. i'm pretty shocked to hear this shit.
i can imagine him terribly concerned that it is making his customer uncomfortable, hence fewer stars, no tip.
i'll draw him better after i draw him a thousand times like i did with choromatsu. :3
girl if i had the money i would &amp; ima fly your ass up here too
y u not sleep? i got my peeps here for a old fashioned game night

people like you trump supporters are why the rest of the world either hates us or laughs at us.
it is an insult to presume they believe it. most are clearly aware of their deceit. better days ahead for those left behind.

i can appreciate misplaced empathy messages - shows at least an attempt, and can further the discussion vs assuming context
the hoarder hillary..cash is her only god...
(2) she has no gut instincts or ability to assess. a pipe bomb explodes in nj then one in ny. what is it? firecrackers?
who allowed all the un vetted i to america???

5'6, that is!
thank you, yes, he loves dogs!
there is nothing about that so-called human and his ketchup sock that i find surprising at this point.
been sayin this
trump is being propped up by his hate. if he was a vanilla candidate, no one would care what he had to say.
trump is popular with his voters bc of his hate. take that away and no one is caring what he has to say.
look at what happened to dapl. stein went and gave them moral support and publicity. hillary said and did nothing.
u can only go down from here tbh
steelers have beaten up on the browns and bengals for a longtime. the ravens are the only team that have matched up well with them

trump was never made to answer a real question about those ties.
trying it now and i'm v happy
that nigga slid in like shhhhh this is just a dream

it's the name not an abbreviation .....
honestly. sometimes i dead feel like i lack empathy and other days i feel like i could burst into tears if i kill a fly
the media has hated the clintons for decades. i've seen it since 1991. it is a lie that hillary isn't trustworthy, etc.
he should have just taken the emmy he just won 4 absolutely skewering trump w nothing but facts &amp; whacked them with it.
btw, "little man" here worked as a bouncer on bourbon st. ;)

those who are willing to short a $1 stock (seeing lots of them in twitterland) must have a very low opinion of themselves.

you take advice on how to vote from an ex convict?
let's not blame an entire religion/population/race for extremists' actions. it only further divides an already divisive world.

can i get that in a pdf?
mr. trump, with all due respect (look the word up), you have divided this country more than any individual in my lifetime!
4/ bottom line: trump is intensely disliked by most hispanic and black voters, but dems can't count on that alone to elect clinton, dems.

racism doesn’t need to be intentional to exist, it’s about the impact the message has and not the intent of the sender.
you are an ignorant fool who relishes on blaming a group of people based on the possibility that a terrorist is a muslim.
i love it! let me know when they're hiring 😊
wait y’all don’t have wifi at work?
this terrorist is an afghan, just like not every afghan is not a terrorist, neither is every muslim a terrorist.

right. worst part is he's backing guy who (correctly) lambasted his old boss mercilessly. shows his lack of loyalty
ironically trump can be attributed in large part to the press he belittles. they never cared to expose him.

kellyanne talks no policy, she talks generalities and lies &amp; has to bc trump is an imbecile.

so you're saying that video is staged &amp; trump doesn't have tons of democrat support? anyways this election won't even be close

you're in the wrong seat sir i'm gonna have to ask you to move.
also, an all clear was just called, so there goes your credibility. you're not reporting news, you're reporting speculation
i tweeted this and waited for you to say those exact words...

prime example of the hypocracy of the media sis h. they focus on something so meaningless rather than something that is major
since ailes left, it is going left. only a few fair &amp; balanced,or conservatives left on fox
another prime example of how they twist everything around. instead of looking at the facts.

dual school systems are never equitable

i think in trump's case he might feel he has to do them to get local attention,becuz he has far fewer commercials than clinton
otherwise, how would the drunk person even put the key in the ignition if "not conscious"?
just in case anyone was wondering ***spoiler***
: nod on "ready" will be decided by armed force. if the r ready than we are ready.

"who's your daddy-uncle???"
it just annoys me bc she has no real idea what she's doing out there, she makes it up as she goes along
i find it easier to read outside honestly if its really bright. definitely easier on the eyes at night as well
it’s this but it’s two whippets and it says “we can make it to the fence in 2.8 seconds..”
paul was robbed bc he really played the game. nic just sat it out or coat-tailed corey.
it was set in stone the moment she walked in the door, people with this mentality shouldn't be on the jury.
who wonders if trump's surge has attrctd genuin malgnt evil spprt aka old royal dutch nazis? worms hidg n woodwork sinc 1950s?
yes, there is a law. it's called brandishing a weapon. you can unholster when you are threatened.
maybe you can present again later on :)
thank you for investing in us today!
but drunk people certainly do not randomly lose consciousness.
really? there was a photo of the employees at his new dc hotel. i could count them on one hand.

the notion of "side effects" is a conclusion, not a fact.
if it 'restored order' it would de-escalate the group. hey, maybe a gas that un-shoots people would work!

chargers gear ???
like i hate nicole but nat wasn't the only one who voted for her, her game was decent enough that it was gonna be close
voicemail? what's that?
in a way its double sad because it shows they know voters are dumb but still cannot attract dumb voters
the media has an insouciant concern for christian bashing and desecration.
you delusional dickheads think trump will bring u the 4th reicht, ain't happening douchebags.
maybe it's about the medium more than message?
shit. did he really?
oh yeah, i don't do that. lmao.
have a good thursday u all (:
that's cool
we gain the correct knowledge about our past and present to know the future we are aware of how they control us, and stop it

they refused to check if the fa saw her belonging. they simply brushed her off. few experienced a lot of issues.

do you know conservatives brains are different than liberals. they are more fearful.
like it congrata
this absence of useful explanations makes learning a tool feel insurmountably difficult and is very demoralizing
they write them down on paper and float them out to sea
you gotta better yourself before you think of someone else

disgusting! i was shocked that he opened for clinton when she spoke in sacto. could his reputation be worse?

executive orders are constitutional. the president does have that power
and his orders were challenged in scotus some were upheld, some not. checks &amp; balances.
he is only a prisoner in his man body but because of existentialism not because he is wolf
there has to be a mass genocide in order for a group of people to be considered oppressed?

they own 10% of uber but are launching a competitor called waze carpool
the previous major release aka iphone 6, was much more substantial. hell, even 6s was a leap, since 3d touch interaction changed a lot.
i'm as certain as i was both times obama won if not more
and uses people for his own end left and right, but she begs 4 $ to...
pretty wild stuff too-i know from resources they've been playing w/servers-etc across nation like never before 2 manipulate info
idk who would find this funny it actually made me upset smh
v good content 👌🏼
it'd be interesting to, &amp; i wonder if anyone has, model adaptive land-use control. eg, high land cost -&gt; auto-upzone
is a nonsense hashtag like .if you dont choose 1,you've chosen the other.that's.it.
well the whole episode got me fuck up that was just a part of it lmaooo 😢😢😢😢😢😢
the whole experience was very disappointing. i'd strongly recommend using android studio &amp; xcode instead, for android java/c++ &amp; for ios.
adaptive land-use control suggested by /: c/

you must be crazy if you think burning cities up is gonna make people hear you, instead of grab their guns and say "not here."

he didn't stumble into a protest-he drove to it wielding a gun to intimidate

what obot? bombshell: ‘washington post’ confirms hillary clinton started the birther movement…
the vocal minority does not speak for the silent majority. no religion condones homosexuality.
everyone forgets about daft punk just right when they come out and drop news
i love play doh, we can make pretty cool shit with it 😂 yeah, we're insane in the membrane…
how shitty of a candidate do the dems have to be losing to a complete idiot like trump! a ham sandwich could be beating him
what kind of pie was that? mint chip?

horrible roommate
lol notice my handle matt mesenplas lol just remember serenity now or namaste while in the kitchen.
😂😂 i seen someone get a donut with bacon on it, almost vomed. ugh

i pray things get better for you. i've been there, trust me. i am holding her acctble. thank u for voting

it was built as well as they could make it- but not to last
it would finally answer my eternal question of why they didn't call the film "air con" mind you
i've replied already to that. awaiting for further details.
since i genuinely use twitter and like to catch up on my stream, i only follow close friends and brands i like. sorry! ;)
oh those silly, crazy satanists, they're hilarious! 😃
the fact is, trump is promoting and advocating racist, nazi memes, supporting kkk and nat stop&amp;search programs
was great to meet you too! just catching up on tweets now after weeks on the road ;)
obama has given hope and change. lowered unemployment by half, lowered uninsured rate 10%, created 15 mil new jobs
if you aren't happier now than 8 years ago, you are republican and therefore worthless and stupid.
i mean games have been able to find the fun in all forms of murder, you'd think they could find the fun in police work
hah, just bumped into them a few weeks ago. fell into it immediately.
also if that's the only way to deal w/their frustration then the problem will not get solved.
oh and the scene that the screen cap is from also made me jump! 😱
shit, that's what it was. lol, i tried to just drown myself in work cus people &amp; i weren't doing too well.
plot twist: they didn't make it nice. you are now addicted.

corl you are my everything!
and tough talking like and the rest cower and say nothing.
trumpistas kept sending me a photo "taken by a witness" that had a tiny indistinct blob they said was a "gun."
and ever and ever
so, i agree the nasty ugly racists are coalescing around trump. the cocktail faux-liberal racists gather round hillry
wow thank u!!!
he's out there snitching on everyone. be careful!
fox news.....fabricated story......nah. what on earth do you mean?
ooh i doubt that
it is charging :)
always love:) - cheers .
you might be dangerous if you had a brain...however.
because it's in the public domain and looked good?
the epitome of the dangers of ignorance.
there's no "limit" on how many exec orders a president can/should issue; just like the prez also has unlimited pardon power
or rather ppl like u projected all muslims as boogeymen and inherently terror apologists which resulted in this.
yup. more faux hrc news. let's not also remember bribery of bondi, illegal use to foundation funds, foreign ties, etc. list goes on
: can't u comprehend the written language? wrote "if&gt;it's gotten worse". bill locked y'all up &amp; bush is voting 4 hrc. says it all
had me walking up to the plate like...
they all have the same bleak landscape.
supporters deny racism exists. then stupidly wonder "why the upset". dangers conservative bubble.
no logic to trump as well the shooting in tulsa now to add to the list of murdering blk americans wake up!!
she was dead a pasty hell rell &amp; was all up in that
oh my god i'm crying hahahaha i legit look at these men like they're idiots
if sanders had not been a jew himself, he would have been accused of being anti semitic by the media as well

haha. yeah.
second thoughts on this one. how would anyone even tell?
but absolutely nothing is surprising anymore. and his supporters don't care.
this woman grew up prior 2 civil rights acts of 1960s &amp; school desegregation. jim crow ruled &amp; yet she claims there was no racism?
thank you so much - and great post on 's great contribution to the film!

tavares deserves to play with a star. deserves to play with a 1st liner(okposo is one) not a 3rd line

i remained remarkable calm (she told herself).
good point-i can't prove god-that's why faith is called faith. but christian theism does answer things science doesn't.
in no court in this land would a call to "run them down" be construed as self defense.
when doing your amazing sketches at real estate conferences are you working or playing? yes!
okposo averaged 65 points over the last 3 years as he has hit his prime. hes pretty good.
even the buff bros with the football?!
ya think maybe they can spot the nazi
not a chance! lol crowds and i don't agree. but good luck to those who do.
i do not see anywhere that it has to do with race.

the library isn't open as long on the weekend :(
thanks christian, glad you enjoyed it.
wtf use uber!
but you're good with "hey, you look like a ******, get the f*ck out of my store"?
once again, you focus on trying to trip people up in your efforts to miss disastrous realities in our biggest cities.

omg!!! noo!! bless! . . . .…
careful dude... matthew 10:33...
i think clintons&amp;obama paid these ppl so they can say trump incites racial violence, we know its not true
it's really hard to be existential and spit game at the same time.
peace and have a great day
while you have a whole deadline looming in the background...
haha big facts!
yes, there might be evolution happening with moral choices-but that also squares with christian beliefs.

around that time we were dealing with a couple fire related calls at the same time around the city.

and again, i believe and trust god, my experience of god, the tested accounts of others, biblical scholarship, and science.
maybe they are prepping a new api for networking and they want people to start hating nsurlsession more?
that is a false equivalence. trump is not mitt romney or george bush. he's not even ted cruz. he's an aberration.
see my most recent blog post for a few examples of that. link is in my twitter bio.
while i am a fan of brian, i respectfully disagree, as amy goodman would be the greatest.

i won't be there but i'm the opposite kind of fan. annoyingly friendly.
so mass migration to england then? palestinian state on the shores of brighton?
the video of the incident doesn't bear your claim out. and why was the life of a terror suspect who fired shots at cops spared?
the lineup is not as deep, correct, but i sense a lot of "here we go again" out of that group
"it's more challenging than ever to get an active reload"
i agree with you. mine was a broader point about the decline of our military stature.

deep time is especially hard when someone can barely think beyond the horizon of their own life.

obvously it was not a full pint of beer!
salesforce and other tech behemoths have products that are similar, and have pressured hootsuite competitively.
here generational argument is dumb. liberals have been silly for decades! just different silly.
podcast up now
but if salesforce suddenly owns one of hootsuite's main data streams, questions arise. benioff probably wouldn't shut them out, but still.
eh, you could pull it off! 😛
no but i thought maybe something cheaper to see if he likes it. something on 3ds vc? or are those a bit arcane?

anyone is a victim whenever someone tries to illegally act against someone
thanks 4 shutting down horrible narrative that prescriptive adjudication is sanction for condemnation &amp; murder. illogical.

i can't believe the generosity of us doods. shine on all of you.
thanks for the spell correct.
usually start from the ground up, so you may want to spray some insecticides around the perimeter of your shed.
that's the philosophy of the obama administration whose purpose is to destroy our republic &amp; turn into communist slavery
funny, here it can sometimes seem the opposite: too much doing cool stuff just because cool stuff should exist.
this is why so many americans have resorted to eating the booty like groceries.
holy crab pots! is that 🙃😅

what if we're playing the giants? wouldn't blue be the way to go?
i hate how much media still sensationalizes queer/trans* lives. trans* ppl have been having kids forever &lt;grumpy&gt;
it's just how we are taught to view roads. this the whole share the road philosophy. it predicates who already owns it
actually ya… maybe “immature” is the right word then. like, “it’s just not quite there yet”
what do you think?
nothing is more important than football not even social justice and certainly not getting a satirical tweet 2 days later!

you can think he was a bad president (and person) but still be decent to him in public
the problem there is not the law, which applies to all. it's access to judicial resources.

they are all left leaning. why? can i join to fact check dt hrc and fact checkers?
that's my problem too. e has a great job, i'm still a sub for schools so i don't have steady pay yet

i definitely agree with that statement.

the director is wrong. trump lies 2 many times abt important issues, mostly big lies ppl should know!
the facts clinton needs to know for the are trump fact-checks, since apprentice moderators won't play that role
he didn't start "crying" until the second half after he had multiple consecutive catches on normal lmao fytb?
well there’s no contest in that case :)
they should only moderate, not be part of the debate!
most of us are tuning in for extra credit
actually, they fell to themselves....... sheesh..........
not the tho
yeah exactly. like it's simply not fun and it's forced on you
dude when we go to ny lets hang out and fight each other's reflections

if we're being fair, harbaugh's teams frequently got their asses kicked by seattle too
that's what i'm saying. about 3 or 4 of his ints aren't on him.
qb engaged, affects throw, no grounding.
opinion plz
2012's romney stand-in prob wouldn't have had to worry about seriously offending obama...
very moving story. thank you for sharing
oh my god! hey lady what are you talking about? it's a crape
yes! and the idea that the obama coalition only came out bc he was black is infantilizing and shows the willful ignorance of the msm.
and here's an accurate representation of what it's like to watch the politics unfold, every time...…
it was at least a- work i'm salty
a candidate like trump is what happens when people feel emboldened to give in to their racism &amp; misogyny.
smh, i wanna kill angela though like give me the gun, i got you ghost. i'll help you
because they usually plow the streets when it snows 🙄
i knew a black guy who got in an accident not his fault. with a white dude. got so freaked out when a crowd of white

well yeah, but better her than him, i think. better someone others call a 'sleazy politician' than an outright hateful bigot.

i'm on record as saying that i think the obvious transphobia of the article was wrong.
i assume it's not within your saves and you can't get them. if i uninstall buried will i get the mark iii raygun?
no, i mean like her voting for the iraq war, pushing bloody coups in honduras &amp; libya, and initiating the syria bloodbath.
that said, i think the revelation of her earlier problematic actions was needed. wish it could have been from a better source.
omfg you two 💘💘
he's really messing up my ff team
the stupid in that statement is just so sad.
sorry i missed this. i am not at dctm anymore. but what exactly do u need it to do?
because i work there and everyone wants to come hang out with me.
blame the front office for poor drafting/free agent acquistions. bad offensive line will give any qb a nervous breakdown.
is there an example in pres debates where mod says, "this is what candidate x actually means when he says this"?
(though maybe he needed malcolm?)
he was at the catania airport last week.
i love you so much omg thank you!😍😭

have lost at least 3 games each of last 4yrs and their o looks pedestrian despite all the talent. they expect more at lsu
i would guess the canada thing
cook something
well since you asked:
i think what those folks don't really understand is that the resources at lsu, due to their state's economy, are not up to par
cook something. can you cook

let me just tour with you when you're famous ok 😘
i know i'm not. nobody is.
they haven't lost to cal since 2003 (12-1, beat michigan in the rose bowl) that year. a loss to cal = firing
if it hit pylon then it clearly crossed plane. wtf is up with that call
definitely michael or ashton
jeez that was a lot.
it's never too late!
you don't need to explain yourself to the mongoloids brother!
*he just tore his acl &amp; we can get great value 😉
houston jumped the gun on a qb and made an ass of themselves*** would be better i guess
yeah, we can have tressel be his defensive coordinators and art brilies be the oc... sounds legit.
imploding. imagine how bad the buccaneers are though??
i heard that bro✊🏾😞
another bad tomlin loss good for 2 a year. team not ready again
better to find out when it doesn't matter &amp; see if we have any reason to risk him getting hurt later. bg isn't the answer.

myles is a little trouble maker! but when i scold, he runs over to me purring, tail up while macy runs away and hides.
this just sounds like fringe conspiracy theory to me
we are all the better. don't care what no one say!
had to give him a shot. now it's just trash either way
fitzpatrick sucks. this guy is small in big games... always
mannn we are beating the steelers 34-3. this is unreal

everyone's crazy tho 😅
it's crazy!!! like 4 makeup applications a day is so much for my fave to handle!! but yes girl thank you!!!
i didn't realize what a cool twitter handle had.
drunk, greedy, touchy scott
cause hillary clinton is going to show donald trump that running the country is not like running a business.

the best thing i've seen all day
wonderful photo; very cheering.
she's been lying for her entire career and flip flopped more times than a dry hamburger
what do she be smoking, she need to market it, cause it got her seeing and saying impossible shit, and she actually believe it
really? so the reports weren't over reacting!
how beautiful is that
ugh. of course.
social justice warriors are what's wrong with america. if they would all move to canada...i would vote for trump.

that’s nuts. adidas rep told me the verification messes up for “various reasons”. i wonder what would happen
ive been saying it for the longest. we need a plague lol
lmao that was a very "aints" move
me too time for a change and i think that's why they put sheamus and ceasro together
teams only look at bo3 snipers and i just don't understand why
is it me, or did he not answer the question?
anybody who cares
no laughing matter they way they lost yesterday!
“i look very much forward”. can we not have a republican presidential candidate who can speak basic english?
seven times he said méxico in his first two minutes
fantastic to see positive sentiment and optimism from the presidential candidate
vs. = trainwreck
fads fade. 😶
huh there was a debate??? :)
lol that's the last place i wanna go for info. but for the comedy, i'll be looking
ha! trumped up trickle down. like that :d
my dad sometimes does that lol
off to a squinty start
are they good quality jobs? we tend to focus on # 's ignore substance
then why didn't people pick up aw snipers at this time last year. just boggles my mind
no one told him that that was the point of a debate… he’s just here to spew fear
nice of his daughter to attend the debate.
i know who will lose: america.
this is some advice for
it's so pathetic that you tweet while you're on stage. oh wait, it's not you. it's your team of minions.
it's very real. trust me.
i'm doing the vicarious livetweet reading. i can't listen to trump's voice anymore
it's pretty 🙄
it's john westerman idk if he has a twitter 😴
nah, watch it! 😂
i can't tell if you're serious or not.
it’s very important to him
why is trump sniffing? he do blow
this is not good for dt.
. just pulled a . "back to the question."
both of these are the worst of the worsta horrible election coming horrible
😍😍 i'm super lucky, my bestie happened to find some tix!
a-ha! totally forgot about jerry's game at texas
riffing and sniffing. ehat's with the sniffing? is he sick?
that's a self-serving version ;-)
not for those of us in the lower class....
would be a dream and a pleasure
this would be so perfect - topical, great fodder, features their emmy winner.
search "blinking" on twitter
her highlighter game is on point too.
he totally did. we all heard it
. all the things you can get at your local
link please!
exactly that man is a parasite
and yes - "sniffling" not "sniffeling" hahaha
also, after all the conspiracies about clinton's health, trump has a cold? 2016 is kinda on a roll.
i think they're both great games in different ways!
...and, "that's called 'business' my dear." condescending.
yeah right betts
i'll give you a hint, it's the most common middle name for dominican dads
hillary had the good sense to get sick two weeks before tonight's debate.
or dropped out to go have fun and retire. but yeah.
it'd be something to talk about at least...
lol i'm here like so.... get to the point 😂
seems boring. i need agapa, i need evolutionary love, i need to grow with it, and love it.
let me know if you will be in nyc this week.
a lot of people rooted for it. low hanging fruit
obviously the pro way to do this kinda thing
coming soon to theaters near u 🤓😉😉😉😉😉
thank you, this exists in sf only, because designers wanna have fun!
i don't date criminals.
he was talking about solyndra i assume
except his base doesn't care. such an ass.
. i had that same thought about ten minutes ago! i'm grabbing a glass of wine and taking sips!
just chugging right now tbh
probably true. but here we are.
i'm not reading this tweet
you think lester holt is napping. why is he there
will clinton say it was because of bernie sanders she changed her tpp stance?
omg, now hillary wants us to buy her book!!!
is it saturday yet? release us from this misery
pro relegation
central american something, because mexico is in north america.
he has no self control whatsoever
snarky hillary's got nothing
nick between the debate, indians &amp; a few rhodes scholars that was watching wwe raw you are the only 1 on my tl watching mnf
what??? that just seems so crazy. like sure maybe some jobs but our entire economy?
theyre up on the website now!! i ordered last week came pretty quickly!
your day just beginning
it's hella funny. trump is a child, and hil is smashing!
i can't. too many layers of powerless anxiety
aren't you staying up for a midnight feast? "are you still awake?" "no. go to sleep".
how many times can you say regulations in one breath??
what have you done h? -t
i think he's letting trump hang himself
agree! reign it in, lester!
this is bothering me so much! let her speak!
he trynna go on break already and shit 😂😂
can you please come to my work meetings and live tweet comments? 😂✌🏾️🙋🏾💁🏾
30 seconds for hillary to rebut the claims. hillary has a fact checker site at to fact check in realtime. 🇺🇸
i'm a genius for taping this
tales of an election year gone awry and other stories
30 under 30 is like beaujolais wine. taste it now before it turns to vinegar. we will hopefully age like a 50 yrs old burgundy.😎
is this weird hand gesture thing also a new york thing???
got to you, didn't he.
give him a sec, he's looking for the taser.
so far he's physically making me ill. shoutout to hillary for handling it well.
they aren't allowed to serve because they aren't licensed for liquid trash disposal
give him enough rope to hang himself
ditto! my sentiment exactly!
he's hilarious
and if you believe that i have a tree of gold in my back yard.
i think i first saw you perform 15ish years ago- serendipity making me smile
i am laughing so hard at this debate
, you're one of the best journalists ever, but you are wrong on this.
fuck you, you've been fighting isis your entire adult life! check my website you dolt!
is he even fucking there?????
in twisted tea currency yes
so true, and he's brain locked on mexico, right now.
this again like i said was the most intense bowls of fucking ramen i ever fought!
he didn't make it thru the first 30 minutes before imploding. the left can now exhale.
not enough alcohol in the world
also at is very flustered by it's hilarious
gave her the double " big league " it's all over for
. that's "yuuuuuuuuge asshole" sir.
she does look good - i agree. but still... i'd be risk mitigating her appearance wherever possible if i were her stylist!
twitter streaming taking it all around the world, alas.
his people are going to eat this shit up tho. big time
not a communist health plan, it's a corporatist health plan. big difference. iraq war is the biggest blunder ever. cost 7 trillion
this is ridiculous. boorish! rude. he is disgusting!
never will...literally ever.
and bush lied about wmd's. they knew saddam didn't have wmd's but they invaded anyway. cheney made $ off the iraq war.
hope she can hold up. rezted
there is supposed to be a clock.
at least it's not on your junk.
you would never know it by looking at the news i follow - all i’m seeing are “that’s business” retweets. both flopping gloriously.
lester getting no respect frfr. he like a substitute teacher.
you can take up time but are u saying anything
i can't vote for these idiots
i also doubt anyone except huge history nerds or filipinos know who he is. i'm both 🤓
almost certainly
+ eddy kenzo + come bring more difficult performance stylezo let him perform
i spent way too much time wondering what answer i should pick. can't decide.
is trump on blow? he keeps sniffing, can't focus, keeps interrupting and can't answer questions ... yeah.
people are seeing a bully with out a plan. he's been yelling since word 4
apparently not.
so she's going to be sheltered against putin and the saudi royal family? awful, awful argument against trump
oh i see. it came off as different to me. i've had bad experiences with therapists over the years,so i'm always suspicious.
oh you was talking about lex 😂😂😂 she wild tho 🤐😂
everything was fine the first few minutes until trump opened his mouth. that's when things went south.
lying, nazi thug.
this is actually worse than i thought it would be.
ill see ya there im moving in with
the more he does the better that moron
does anyone else see the microphone shadows on hillary looking like pit sweat stains?
he's a train wreck.
except trump is coming off like rude a**hole.
its built from the taliban, i believe thats where he gets the time line from
duda struck out ty kelly up
damn it i forgot the apostrophe
really? he's yelling and screaming. she has smiled throughout. calm, composed. pretty clear who is winning.
congrats but he should have better timing if people are going to notice.
engaging with the absurdity of it all/horror-tweeting!
that's trump has lost the debate
esp since she went on about people being hurt, and he jumped in with "its business."
same but goodbye horses
agreed ... it raises blood pressure and makes people want to smoke and eat carbs lol
694 million. i'm about to pull an ivanka
. of course it was.
u think i wear a colored jersey. i root for the truth.
a bigly bubble.
. can you win a debate by not rolling your eyes? or calling trump a douchebag?
donnie calls it "business." if everyone gets laid off, he can hire peeps cheaper!
"i'm the best at getting audited."
i literally went to twitch to check like 5 minutes ago
because this is america and we are full of bad choices :/
marco rubio is probably enjoying the karma.
.'s faces though . 😂 -
i wouldn't be with her if she was the only one running. have no idea why she just keeps smiling and laughing! she's a moron!
are you kidding?
where your tax return is?? do reply to this question!!
are you blind? he's acting like a fucking phyco
holt: "um, audit doesn't prevent you from releasing your taxes" trump: "i will do it as soon as lawyer says ok. or cuz her emails"
he's playing to his ignorant sect of people in the usa that buys his crazy rhetoric -.-
he has words, he has the best words
his actions are allow'd for ratings tv, this behaviour is totally irrational for public office.
like nobody rly finna take him seriously come on now
he is in his feeling now.....
don't they all do in some form or the other?
wth!!!! no!!!😖😡
"as soon as the shredding - i mean the auditing - is complete"
they deleted it. the internet has infinite memory, though!
omg now i have to look for it , didn't even realize lol
considering how many times she interrupted sanders in the primary debates, it is odd seeing her on the other side.
you are so right
yes indeed! made for snapchat
he's still trying to navigate his drive way 😂
it's called mansplaining and he's pulling the white male privilege by talking over her and interrupting...
lol seriously! today we were really nice
definitely, &amp; i'm terrified
that's why i don't reply to the people's dumb tweets because they think they're right too
old saying " never argue with an idiot they will beat you by their experience"
you should really do actual research not trump quotes and fb right wing pictures
lol i already have the rocky theme in my head. i'm ready to box lmfao
just like this presidential debate. &amp; you never know who we touched . 💕
kayne doesnt look like a bad option at this point
"that wasn't even a bad story"—
trump paid no taxes. trump donates nothing to charity, trump in league w foreign banks -liar !
always been a fan of that word☺️
my car broke my xbox
bragadocious is a word?
not sure what this has to do with the fact that both debate participants are reprehensible human beings.
she's been doing a good job of keeping him on the defensive...🤔😉
. claims we wouldn't learn much from his tax returns. so why has he yet to release them, hmm?
lol i get it.
its about time this country had someone who knows something about money running it?!?? how dare you
is that a word ?
i am so confused lmfaoo
key word maybe!
he can't control himself when anyone impugns his money. anything but that.
well, i mean he did say $14 million investment to start his business from his father was a "small loan" in 1975...
you're not drinking enough
it was on sale. it's usually $3-$4👍🏾👍🏾
he doesn't pay any taxes why is he complaining?
i wondered the same
laguardia airport is the worst!!
huge congrats - awesome to work with / well deserved!
hey what's your take?
what about ord, though, what about ord?!?!?!
no you don't it's not pretty😏
"maybe because you haven't paid income taxes in years." yassssss
sadly i have to agree.
a spoiled one. he's ridiculous.
to be fair lga is absolute shit. worst rated airport in america and it's not even close
it was my pleasure to be in it, but thank you for including me &amp; also the my applause to you 👏💙😘😘
but how can anyone know for sure???
? i'm failing at hashtags
it's so hard traveling in private planes tho
i'd like to think i'm smart by not trying to get jailed by the irs so i pay taxes
has taken no responsibility for the results of her hacked email server.
to bad it was spent by bush administration , do some fact check
just sharing our kids' comments. just did for hillary too. equal &amp; balanced. no bias in our articles. not trying to offend!
lol thank you wes 💕. i have somin new to show you from today lol got my purple back.
braggadocious is a word :)
it's terrifying.
basically. smh...lol
yeah, i've flown through hanoi and quito. lga is luxurious in comparison.
. this is awesome!! finally hilary
. reads on not paying his workers &amp; 'stiffing' people out of pay .
isn't that how you started the shop? you're being hypocrital. plus a wall is like a big ledge if u wax it.
i am following the twitter comments, many of which are great, and will likely watch the entire thing later,
missed the chance
o hare i find to be passable
well now we'll find out with their match about to happen in a couple of mins lol
yeah, and he just said his tax money would have been squandered too. admission of guilt, no?
you gained so many followers from his tweet oh my 😂😂😂 happy birthday haha
it was a joke...
it is even more shocking that half of the population think he is suited to be president. we are living in idiocracy the movie!
yeah? is the wifi wack?
ugh, this hurts my heart.
because i smoked pot and read dc comics.
i don't worry about making tweets, just wait for you to do the heavily lifting and i retweet ;-) &lt;3
... let me just zoom in on that for ya
also jfk is mad nice lol
they are loving it. this is their dream.
i was actually expecting him to make a joke about obama golfing on his courses
why does cedrick alexander sounds familiar
how is he not part of the status quo, which is governed by money?
"wrong." "it's all words. it's all sound bites." -
so sorry to hear that. i'm glad we get to see the real t
i was audited last year. nys accused me of not spending 8,000 dollars my senior year at nyu.
this sounds interesting! i want to take a look at the book on friday if okay with you!
where do i get reservations so i can throw up on the lobby carpet?
less in favor of "don't pay your design /construction team".
sure, but i've really gotten into terminal 5 (live music!!)
you and i are listening to different debates, respectfully. it's not about punching, it's about facts/lies.
mad shade to tsa. i mean i don't like taking my shoes off anymore than the next guy but come on
literally tho
oh right she met joyce pensato lol
gaslighting. projecting. deflecting. textbook sociopath behavior
guilt. guilt on you zack.
so is "the donald" saying that americans who pay their federal taxes are stupid?
h, you pay zero taxes - money laundering through your foundation.
it'd be a bad strategy to go after his base, though, yeah? more sensible to target that elusive swing voter?
or sniffing a lot and gulping water.
launching what?!
good idea for those who can stand hearing open his mouth. i cannot.
idk i'm pretty down with lil john and missy elliot
she blundered delivery. great line. bad sound bite
. "let's talk about race." crowd at gets even more lively
to be clear, this needs to be discussed, and i hope it gets plenty of time. but trump is gonna fuck this up so bad.
the world moaned.
not to be sniffed at
the part-2 meltdown hasn't happened yet.
i'll release my tax returns when releases the 33,000 emails she deleted is not condecending
that hashtag is everything
he also said that not paying tax is called smart.
oh lord! lololololol 😂😂😂😂😂😂
yes. but i also realize privilege of living in usa and paying my fair share. he makes millions, pays nada. that's patriotic?
look in the mirror loony...
if trump &amp; his rich pals paid taxes the past 15 years, we would have money to do that
the new sunset?
hillary side steps the email question, she lied.
but its the pro-vaxxers, you know, we * that are rude, not the calm &amp; decorous vaccine-questioning**
i'm not ready for this. i can't take this
my impression is that she has trump on the defensive.
"look at charlotte, the city i love" yeah sure donald 😂😂
nope. people like you who vote for people like trump who make those self serving laws. that's how that works.
actually loves this book &amp; is a gaiman fan. was a little out there for me so i abandoned it. 😁 maybe i'll revisit?
she won the coin toss i guess that means all night long *shrug*
ya, seems to have gone down when he sent ppl there... v weak.
oh shit you're right!!
bc she is not smiling. the donald sounds like a moron but she gets criticized over this
he on that powder.
yeah, duh lol but you don't get the principle?
time to join a credit union!
well....they are w-o-r-d-s with l-e-t-t-e-r-s
how's studying?
i've met alot of white kids that are lowkey republicans but they're usually kids who are in the industry due to nepotism
report, then block.
"african-americans are living in hell" and "need more law-and-order", is now, as it always was, an appeal to white voters.
law and order? how about sensible gun control
what are you watching?
roll a d20 for next outcome.
lets sell him
check your dms
both. my house is super big. i need marble everywhere.
🌹's are red, 💙's are blue....
cause he's nervous as hell. dry mouth, hence the sniffles.
you not even from here, "african american communities are being decimated by crime." shut up.
they teach u that b/c those are the cpas ppl will hire. that doesn't make it right.
dude i was so hyped when i saw his promo!!!!!!!
blowing the racist dog whistle.
nothing because is the most incompetent company on the planet and has an outage on my block
can he even be moderated?
our tweets on this are kindred maybe we should be writing partners idk just spitballing
. white people don't shoot people!!!! wait!
or maybe like a shitty version of gre vocab flashcards?
you're fucking awesome
beautiful segway combination. both solid blows. can lester stop the fight at this point by ko?
it wasn't but i've moved on to the next topic thanks for playing
i am dying laughing, my brother does the best impression of that
but not on equal levels tho hillary is like a tv dinner trump is like melted black licorice off a hobo booty
just the laguardia part shit is so behind
where's marco right now
she seems energetic.to me.
i feel bad for associating orange lizards with him but he's can't be equal to humans.
or just read twitter
. i love you, the dictionary
plantains (green or ripe) =\= bananas (green or ripe)
lmaoo ard it's not that deep 😂
out of the hands of criminals
me too. and that they resent smart women, so her reason works against her. this is my fear.
trump said during the debate that buying houses when the market crashed was good business!
sorry, i had to set plans in motion when i saw that he was serious about running for president. i play no games
she's such a liar
this is how i know you're streaming this on the internet. wait a tic.
there's been tons all night..."biglsy"
i know, right?
omfg gangs of new york
why do they even have an audience?
he almost failed me but he taught me well
ill be the priest @ the wedding
hillary clinton is right and donald trump is wrong
that's what a president does control things in a calm manner
and you need to develop relations in the communities by having a cop personally stop and search each and every one. lots.
"police judge" your welcome networks.
i'm not a kid, and i was meeting pedantic nothingness with pedantic nothingness. have a good night.
lmfao i fucking hate that argument! so untrue
exactly one year ago i got on a plane in venezuela, and lower in new york, i thought i was in another world! 🙄
he's wrong. he's wrong, and she's right - she spoke about the beauty of the black communities she's seen.
excellent tune kadondo
did you miss his bit about china?
and giuliani was the worst ever!!
cait ive been bumpin to this song all weekend, i love marc bassy
at least they didn't disparage your height!
that was a doozy!
disgusting people may vote for her!
it's not gonna get any better if that racist wins the presidency
-- the first relatively free election in kashmir happened in 1977, reflects the influence of jp too
not trump i hope
bruh i was at slander &amp; i said "this opener is trash i can't wait til slander comes on" &amp; this girl was like "wait who's that"
i feel this on an emotional level irl rip ****
well...calm, at least
that's also yet again hellariois. we need to put guns in the hands of law abiding citizens to shoot back then crime retreats
immigrants are protected by labor laws. illegal aliens should be deported. they are not immigrants
come home dustin
he need his shot of cocaine, he's a freaking paedophile that supplies models w/drugs &amp; pimp them to d0uche bag rich new yorkers.
how is she delusional
sadly it might to the people he thinks he's speaking to. :/
the more money we spend oversees on military the less goes to the community, perfect breeding ground for the red army
she had to learn to do everything bill did, backwards and in mom jeans.
can we please revisit the conversation about laguardia? i fly out on wed. and would really appreciate a bar inside the terminal.
that's exactly what i was thinking.
youtube live streaming should work in sydney
i don't know and it is driving me fuckin nuts
if it is 60 in iceland they have geothermal springs by the beach so the weather is perfect 😬
i've already depleted the beer and i'm still way too sober for this
and sexism! don't forget sexism!
what if there is a civilization out there in which baby vomit improves the value of a thing
this is going to bang (pun intended)
wait what does that mean?
if trump wins it will be the fault of hillary voters who picked hillary over sanders and the dnc who rigged the election against him.
omg so lucky so your seeing him three times in manchester
let's hope more and more women feel that way.
that actually looks good lol
burn, mrs. clinton burn!!!
i didn't make that mistake
he needs a spray bottle full of water for whenever someone interrupts or goes over time.
amazing how twitter has changed things.
gurlllllllll i was thinking the same thing
honestly jordan i would rather you be president
oooo i'm sorry you have an opportunity to move back lol
that's cool what rows are you in
so... par for the course?
republicans would be worse but u cant turn a blind eye to ur own party's problems.
and shes still kicking ass.
not even he knows.
you have an egg as ya profile pic hold this l
nothing to do, compared to the fascist dictators of venezuela, this "man" is a child playing to 'the little house'. 😂
what's a troll bot?
at least hillary is like "police need to be retrained &amp; need to work with the black communities. their churches &amp; businesses"
it's a good thing i'm drunk cause i understood that
i mean, that was never a reason when i was in law school ...
let's face it some are so repugnant !
when trump speaks it's like when a 6 year old is first learning how to put some verbs and pronouns together
maybe im sleeping but i wasnt aware the illegal gun owners are gonna see new laws, just drop their guns and obey
adverb verb noun noun --mind blown
looks like it kept falling to me.
i nearly spit out my rose 🍷
i had a bet on it and i'm currently losing 🙄
at least he's liked african americans for the last little while
vote for hilary though
would anyone ask for donald's birth certificate?
certificate was produced he spent another 4 years trying to falsify that as well. he's a racist, ignorant bigot and i'm pissed !
but in the end she's just feeding lies and giving you what you wanna hear.
sorry to hear
i don't do attacks on people's appearance, no matter what i think about their politics or policy positions
okay. wow. holy shit. that was phenomenal. 😩👏🏾
"over the pass - ah - little while."
bro the conversation is resolved.
more like nonsensical idiot liar year that much better pos
nah, we all bored to death.
oh, that! score?
why didn't you get george bush jr., sr., clinton, reagan to share their birth certificates?
:-* thanking god
oh wait can i like my own tweet?
because trump accused the first black president of not being a citizen and the subject of the debate is racial tension.
think about what pence is doing right now… slitting his wrists? banging his head against the wall? drowing in tears?
good, it better
and i'm kinda happy to be australian
yeah def. not perfect, but pretty on point. dts tryna pretend he's not racist but he literally retweets white supremacists so
how the fuck do you know what i'd do, ? i believe in this country, and loathe that greedy assholes work the system.
i'm a realist. but yes we can all "hope" 😉
dt sniffs,,,guilty
tru but i love so many people that are just not on the same page ..... ugh
it got worse because of him
yes and i didnt mean to get assissinated
alright im trashed
holy shit lol “we settled with no admission of guilt” as a point of pride. amazing.
fire up the dimensional shitter
why would move his companies out of if they r only paid 30 cents/ hour? as he calls it i bet
yea its called systemic oppress. we should all be checking our own biases. thats her point.
we can agree tide has turned, yes? he was comfortable talking economy before, not so much now
of course you agree with h, you are getting paid by h campaign to run to take votes from trump.
of course brotha
no doubt, this is the quote of the debate
lester suck he is bais
mr. sniffles is bothering many of us
wheres my cookie
grimm starts january 6th
i'm all good thanks. hope you are well too!
it's true. they were marked "c" for colored.
she needs a backbone against him, i need to teach her how to be a polite bitch😀
. better trump line would be "i was so racist that you went to my wedding!"
exactly... lmao only way to get ahead in this country is to educate yourself, take risk and work hard man
i disagree he's counterpunched very effectively
or sneeze cocaine.
so you're saying that all blacks / latinos are criminals? actually it doesn't work.
gun control is the only plan has. it won't work because criminals will always find a way to get guns!
right. they're employees.
reagan tripled the debt in his presidency. clinton paid off most of it, with money left over.
hardly know holt is there...
we're getting a promo ot for sure
right! he let in minority multi-millionaires so he's definitely not racist. guy is such a clown!!
anything about rec and parks or cbd-managed downtown spaces getting closed to public for party rentals when so little parks
she needs to stop this, i respect the president bullshit. her 08 campaign was nasty and racist.
even if he loses it will embolden the next generation of trumps.
hit on taxes/birther what about her he emails? he is unfair
i aint gonna mess with my mom when she changes the channel unless i wanna die
same. it's like watching an on field injury. you gotta know what's going on.
in all seriousness there was never a grain of hard evidence, it's all circumstantial
i wish jon stewart was still doing the daily show. he'd be on this like crazy
murder in nyc is down 4.3% and serious crime is down 2.67% through sept. 18 compared to the same time last year.
thats gross
hill shd give it back harder and get under his hair
lmao, that's him
fact check me
but why does he always have her answer first?
it would be a good idea to do such articles every now and then for people like me trying to get into comics 😁
nope, that lucky yet. needs to nail to the wall &amp; cut off his tiny little winnie.
this is me right now lmao all that is different is a bottle of titos
2/2 i'm glad the safety team at uber is (not) doing it's part. license plate 7npw790 black mazda if you care (😂)
they're making me emo
terrible immigration police
fuck lmao. shes gonna uncover all of the secret files this nation is hiding away
help you in whatever department you need.
donald trump loves to tell us how great he is. he looks and sounds crazy.
listen i don't have to prove anything to u, i know what blk ppl r saying re trump, so u have your opinion and i have mine
i was thinking just that
watching in a bar. for efficiency
u win a prize of funny. it is a six pack of pbr. due to inflation sorry.
thanks, walnut. being down can kill a cow if down too long.
listen to the demagogue i was just endorsed shut up djt you are so full of yourself
thanks for leadership
did he say ice?
his son is unbelievable with computers?
trump's jokes got a lot of laughs in new york (amongst mostly democrat crowd) -- not sure it sounds the same in california
- he cracked the case...a 400 lb person sitting in their bed hacked the dnc 🤔 good grief!
"yasss queen the gag is to drag hunty the tea is flaming hot"
thanks for the retweet!
hit on taxes/birther what about her he emails? he is unfair
talk about endorsements when you're clueless about cybersecurity...and hack back...bring up 10 yr old
when he has to speak beyond 30 seconds he's screwed. scrambled gibberish.
13 love cousin!!!
after some reaserch i noticed his appearnces are very limited, they are memorable however
pretty sure he's making a nerd joke
didn't work in south africa once mandela passed. sustained, fairness, equality &amp; equity works best.
😂😂my sister was there so she took it for me thanks baby
in fairness non of those things spontaneously combust... or are ridden by twats! 😜
will trump bring back dancing hamsters? i bet he can bring back dancing hamsters.
the one instant of the night of few
i can send emails too.
misspelled words belong nowhere near debate night
ok this is funny liz
i think that's a valid point. racial bias is not just a police thing everyone in the us has biases.
yes! she does this shit all the time 😫😭
dirty trick tryna keep me sober
the highlight of tonight's is the twitter feed :)
maybe it was ren?! who says it was russia!
here you go. hillary's guy blumenthal started the birther thing. so go complain to hillary:
i think he is sipping some alcohol not that he needs alcohol to act stupid
trump (cont.): we need to figure out the cyber. all the cyber. cyber, we have to do better. i have a son. he's very good with the computers.
i own property in sandwiches and i can vouch for that.
he just did a sound byte for them: "they're beating us at our own game: isis."
this is perfect lmao
yeah i think so
your talking about what i said and nothing about what he said your the one not listening
the next version of jetpack will protect cyber
ah you should text back
sorry- overload. fugelsang says fact checker hung himself.
chestnuts roasting by the dumpster fire …
trump's son will solve cyber security. big relief to those of us in silicon valley.
don't feel bad, domi. i often take a wrong term off the information highway.
oh man so many. give me a min
the new shot heard around the world!!!
if you leave after this victorious evening you're a fool.
i told hayley the same thing 😂
u realize ur not great
never stop tweeting about this.
laptop only sets, no hardware.
and i just gave them to you today 🙄
the fact is that she claim is her ally but went against him hard in of 2008
american intel has never confirmed the russians were behind the hacks. your remembering the spin that came out of the dnc
more people need to at least be talking about this more people in our generation need to care again
i have two choices right now and i think i chose the wrong one.
does the sniff).
yep, three more to go
omg he just did this again but he shouted wrong like 5 times
thats i.c.e. immigration and customs enforcement. not isis
just showing him the same care everyone piled on hillary for her cough
barron for secretary of homeland security
while hacking the irs to find his tax returns
literally in your classroom right now learning about js
killing me. going to close now!!
i think he's trying not to be a mouth breather? like me when i run, "in through your nose..."
but general public seriously does not know that acronym, admittedly
house in villa ter out-of-electriks.
with cyber austin. we'll take it and cyber it back home
the speed here is insanely impressive
cuz ufc knows msg will be a sellout based on the newness factor. they can put anyone on the card
i miss him already
trump is an embarrassment to our country - he speaks like a 2nd grader
all he's done is talk absolute trash this dude has 0 idea how to run a country he's a business man go back to doing business
you've come a long way since earlier in the year. 🤔🤔🤔
none of that was your fault. its the law to have your dog on a leash :-)
"a very against police judge." , you and are killing me! please ! !
going to get from library asap!
i'm listening to this the entire time like
stop blaming bush for what you and obama have done. you're pitiful...
i heard big 400 lb fatties hunched over scary computers may be there
hang in there...it's almost over...right?
we can't catch a break my dude. 😔
i broke down to and went to wild: rice and bread
the need for a commercial break. i'm outa beer
turn the volume up lol
actually convinced can see the future at this point.
have and use on new systems, but wish it wasn’t chrome only. :-/
all i see is pointing fingers and no real solutions
democratic, sure. (or “modern”, even). but i’d suspect there have been some long-term alliances in human history
you don't have to vote.
if it wasn't so serious i would laugh. he is talking about omorosa and her family. smh. he is so racist he becomes blind &amp; deaf
he's been asleep at the switch for sure
the house of representatives
lmfaoooo why my 7 year old cousin speak better than him ☕️sip this hun
&lt;-mean lady will start ww3, hrc is in no position to defend us vs. cyberwar.
millions of people think it is reasonable. leaders need to take ignorance like that head on. she should not have let it pass
100% forgot there was a football game on
i just want obama to be president forever 😫😫😫😔😔😔
i know but she's still an old lady
i can probably write it
forever my fav 😍😍👏🏽 💖
i support this
ha for sure. it's amazing any candidates lie nowadays. then again narrative wins. sigh.
for how much he loves the city he certainly loves bashing its businesses/politics too.
buddies go way back..
i know i suggested she wear the robe from the show
i have close friends that truly believe trump is a good candidate and a good man. it blows my mind.
you got comcast? lol it's on the big channels
how about undergrads?
congrats babe
apparently not. (also, i love you!)
yeah internal indeed! the moderator is a joke!
this is a sick burn for service workers everywhere
what did they do
you're killing me 😂
somebody tell me this is a joke
best fact checker i've seen of the many circulating, delightfully thorough
it's actually stunning how she can do it. shows she has tons of restraint cause a tone else would just be going nuts.
wait you were going to watch this "debate"/circus totally sober?! 🍷🍸🍷🍸
(well and i had just gotten done talking to my brother for 45min)
. did you call the other day?
you mean they better off due to the electoral college**
bout to fearlessly dive into the unknown.
there you go again, it's all words
i will. will call him a douche. 😂😂😂
well it was v thoughtful of you tyvm
why come here to take our jobs when they can work for trump back home?
all he talks about is money
ain't that the truth
one day you'll look at nypd's owner data. but i know facts mean nothing to some
so that's why that one time i thought you were donald trump :&gt;
is that in the fact checker?
i work for suitsupply as a salesperson. best to come in and have me fit you.
its gonna be bad either way but i just can't stand hillary hahah
because donald won't shut his mouth. lester needs to interrupt his loudmouth more
if only she had been a better parent when it was an infant
steve can i come to canada i'm scared i promise i won't ever make fun of the leafs ever again
can someone get him a straw so we doesn't smudge his lipstick
immigration and customs enforcement
'preparing' to be potus ? preparing to not hack up a lung or......some 'other' happenstance.
ugh same! wish you were here!
this is too important not to do so
: voted for iraq war.
you'll learn soon enough
the insanity on the screen is terrifying.
mine is not clear. but i do need another glass
definitely a dress rehearsal.
so ignorant so stupid just like the rest of the ugly deplorables filled with lies and hate you are disgusting
omg ive always thought max was part nebelung!!!
doing a lot of repeating tonight
sean hannity is racist just like trump, and would say any thing to get a republican elected.
i did that shoulder shake in litigation settings with male attorneys
it's central!
damn i had al bundy in the pool
also can we all pls stop saying hillary is even remotely as much of an "evil" as trump
i'd like both candidates to name sources. both have "read something the other day." …
, whoa! minds synced. both sent at 10:23 😱
haha. i feel for that poor woman.
h, you can't be trusted with emails. with codes neither!
wow. that is what implied means. i'm tweeting this slowly for you.
oh, i don't think that's the best example of racism; he wouldn't have respected any moderator.
speak softly and carry a big stick- teddy roosevelt
i did i took the top the doors and the other top off
optically trump is coming off like a rude, unfit, unprepared a**hole: frequent interrupting, talking ovr hrc/lh - bad optics!
as far as i know, trump is the only candidate that's a defendant in a child rape trial.
o !!! right?!
h, you can't be trusted with emails. with codes neither!
his tiny little finger.
you sum it up beautifully.
she wants to be prez -she has to fight back! she's letting him roll all over her.
show the whole quote
yes, i don't know why i'm not watching something else. maybe when i finish this beer...
explains why his website went down
so true because it would be worse than it is now.
honestly i don't blame you my country is turning into a joke because of this candidate 😕
a great perspective during the debate!!
all that was a bunch of malarkey!
hey hey hey! no fighting!
and serious gun control.
he is doing a lot of the talking.
please and thank you.
there is no moderation.
lester looks like a high school ref trying to control a manchester derby.
he's lying.. nobody believes you even your family trump you are dumb!!!
silly, he knows more than all the generals that ever generated.
hey hyd all the info on the beats are here
that's great!!
he is literally this character right now
i'm seething
yes! so many words, so little substance!
are you going to random house open house on dec 15
i'd listen to howard stern over sean hannity
that's exactly what he means...facts
she destroyed him. period!!!
if by "well" you mean screaming incoherently about bad people, his winning temperament and climate change being inconsequential.
yes ...who do you think ran the country while bill was with his interns ?
peach with an r 🙏🏻😩🙌🏻
we're practicing for the future.
clearly has had the educational system fail them
when you only have conservatives voting that's the result you would expect
intelligence and honesty are important. action isn’t a debate tactic.
so how would you like people to specify when they are talking about those folks in those cities?
he will come back with some scary scenarios
i have 100-1 odds on .....there's still time.
me literally 100% of the time
water watch as hillary said, "words matter when you run for president"... trump takes a swig
that's a fire line
is there a vote on the weakness of moderation
he didn't destroy himself. but i don't think he won anyone over. so it comes down to organization.
and he doesn't answer the questions!!!
tom brady doesn't rehurse he practices.
dt is a scam artist and when he shows his taxes you will find the you are paying his taxes
if you two need to leave the country you can come to me 💜
he is a freaking jersey. trump, you cannot buy class
but just one more out!!! tribeeeeee
how would you know something like that? and with all due respect both w bush almost took us all the way down. obama was next😐
tbh rise by
exactly the more he speaks the more he entangles himself (foot in the mouth disease)
is just not doing a good job moderating tonight.
hats seriously sooo depressing just thinking about it, money just washed away💔💔
that's not a secret, he literally said it during the commander in chief forum, but no one picked up on it. so sad. 😢
his mansplaining and male privilege is killing me!
trump actually doesn't seem to have an understanding of how alliances and trade deals work
which, once again, probably will not matter in the least, but a candidate did have to assure allies across world of mutual defense.
than* but idk about that this debate is pretty rough
you're wrong! if he does die, he's gonna be brought back okay *ugly cries*
it's also anti-liberal. disagree, sure. never say the criticism shouldn't be made.
hillary to trump: let's see you handle my old job as sos and then let's talk about who has "stamina"
h, you are responsible for death of 4 americans in . you are not qualified.
chill lmfaoo u switched it up you told me in person tuesday
great q. will get back to you a bit later after i convince my toddler to sleep. 😉
scope out !
hillary is a meanie!!! - donald
but of course, he denies saying it. like the iraq war.
to be exact, union that workers belong to did--ice itself can't endorse. first time union's endorsed anybody.
i wish you guys would express your feelings more...🤔😉
can't believe it's par for the course with this asshat
lmao i just said the same thing. trying to parent on stage
i get it, neither candidate is ideal for many of us. but who is gonna screw us least?
i hate si much that this election has brought us to the point of voting for incredible corruption vs complete incompetence.
delete your account now liar
i'm trying to decide who you support by your tweets, but they're very cryptic...almost poetic! (sub dad for daddy, better ring!)
if i only watched or or i might believe that. unfortunately, i and most millennials know that she's shady, bruh.
well she has great stamina to keep a straight face throughout this lol
i'll take down hillary if you'll take down trump 👍
u hav to get this out on fox or lizette. holt made same mistake
honestly, i'll fuck his whole day up. i'll go off for years about it.
i feel ya, but keep in mind that one of those two will be prez. and if i had to choose, rather it be hillary
and i'd be on the corner singing some sam cooke
this is also how i feel about paula abdul when she was on american idol
it's just the beginning
unless he drops out, he will. so i'll take that bet.
tru and they atleast win
why are you in my mentions
this is gross
i really wish people were not wasting their time watching this dumb debate featuring 2 idiots.
not according to . thought he looked great and had substance.
what day are the services?
exactly!!!!
love me some . need to switch to her!
your not the only one, glad it ended
😫😫 that's still a tough choice nfs 😭😭
please also congratulate me for not hitting a car on my bike today and not shooting up a liquor store.
and singing "half breed"?? 😂😂
my cousins work there!!!
so why didn't you pivot and bring these things up?
i cant wear contacts ill lose them
yo that was hilarious! she's like, i have literally talked to every country you just mentioned!
stop the hillarity!
hilary clinton is not wearing her american flag pin???? she suppose to be the leader of our country.
great track
hands down, she won
well.. lester lost.
i come for the snark but totally start for the rhetorical critique
also, howard stern
it was excellent
hillary is an awful debater.
he's a germaphobe...he doesn't like shaking hands
too high a price. (but i will show you more baby pics.)
😳😳😳 that went by quickly
fatties will be executed every tuesday's at 8am eastern standard time
and nothing about deplorables even though it was set on a tee for you. choker.
o'malley nailing it.
😢 crybaby in chief. hillary spanked you hard. go blow your nose, loser.
the 1/2% and banks rule this world. period.
so she called the restaurant and they told her they cancelled my order for a completely different reason!!!!! okay. bye.
said he'll bring manufacturing back 2 us but he manufacturers all his goods in 12 other countries.
i pretty much went broke buying them but they'll be worth it.
so happy it's back this week!
wow whatever
i can go on a whole rant but you're really not worth my time honestly, grow up man pay attention and stop being so self centered
someone missed the debate.
you also can't support racism and say you think everyone is equal. can't have both.
the cleave got me actin republican. i can't even lie.
awh this is so so sweet!!!! i love u jenna 💘 miss u so much
isn't this nuts?! talk about it on talkshow . we want to hear from you.
probably because he doesn't know the facts
don't despair yet. i think you read this wrong.
..and that would be because you hate this country? and christ, maybe?
absolutely the best bbq. had some on sunday.
they are not troubled by it they have their criminal justice system to deal with that plus where is the correlative things that created it?
or just anything about the debate
omg he might see a poor person.
i will not be voting 4 clinton. don't stand for something you'll fall for anything.
not even. trump wore hillary down so much that at the end the only thing she had on him was that he was a sexist.
here come the excuses! this is hilarious.
i hope you are correct
true and true
yeah now you can just flat out lie.
..hope so sis. i wanted to see a fatality tho. trump still won that debate regardless
again "assertive women are judged more harshly. implicit bias is a problem for everyone implicit bias is a problem for ever"
also, trump exposed all the problems hillary has created and failed to resolve over the years.
i actually think lester is doing a great job- and both candidates are poking eachother, with little interuption
i agree, but i think she's controlled &amp; progress can be made with her.
how can you vote for someone who never replies and always avoid questions. she made a mistake and tonight again she admitted it.
"this post sponsored by guccifer 2.0"...
but at least the oil isn’t in chicago because it is worse than a warzone. did we try stop and frisk in iraq?!
gimme hillary pryor over donny manziel easy
my tweets are always tweets of the year nick, but thank you
will hilary release 30000 emails for trump tax release ?
despicable and atrocious
what policy? the dude knows nothing..
girl, i was begging for a commercial break! lol
hey hyd check these beats
that was a annihilation it was like a football team going up against a high school football team
i literally called that she would wear a red suit i'm so happy she did.
fuck y'all my snaps were funny as fuck
fascinating though as romney had only brief bounce after first debate. if it is really change debate then she might slip
yes lmao second time it's happened to me in 5 days
hillary. trump was just white noise
literally not even a second. i've barely seen commercials for the show. but, i think it's time.
oh my gosh same it's the best highlighter on the market
sorry i don't speak canine can you repeat that sparky?
yep, follow the money please.
of course you will say that but it is what it is!
no it is donald trump lies and he is a jack ass and we want hillary clinton to win
everytime he had hilary caged up, she would smile to show her cool and it happened very often tinight.
well done hillary! trump finally found a good makeup artist.
he needs to blame us brown people cus we are voting!
i guess bald heads are a blank canvas. ;)
oh the grammar is just delicious
no he didn't
fuck off kkkunt.
that is all we want to know. lol.
not going to the prom. just really good with someone who has a clue and not crazy. someone really competent.
some, yes, but there were too many times when holt didn't stop him when he was going on too long
a women who pressed a button and deleted 30,000 emails should not be trusted with nuclear codes!
in no way did she kick his butt. she lied and blinked the entire night
and i have been to falls.
let's start a hashtag.
thanks, we need it!
yes talk about it.
agreed. *looked* and *behaved* like a leader. simple as that.
if there was one big bomb i think it may be the stamina comment.
lies, liar, pathetic!
it's infested with idiots, there's only one solution, nuke it from orbit,
this reminds me- can you leave a review for my app? 😜
hillary's calm demeanour was a good strategy and worked to her advantage as trump lost his cool and came out swinging, as always.
actually, she looked smug and indifferent rather than concerned about the people. your hrc blindness isn't helping her improve.
what is that though!!??
i agree he could've pushed on the emails issue, but then she ended it by admitting the full fault
very good podcast.
i learned about it on beam weeks ago it'[s aight it's aight....
went to a book launch
no! thank you for sharing 😉😊
is weirdly deferential to her. is she the one woman roger ailes didn't try to fuck?
less buck shot and more duck/turkey. more .22lr. but that's a good thing. less 5.56 and more .223
or just fire him for the 26th time
i should have had this tonight while watching the debate lol would have helped me
i'd like to think that hrc won't do a complete reversal on the progressive policies adapted by the democratic platform.
the way the debate was run put trump on defense all night , i think common people understand him, he's not been in politics 30 y
but actually s/o to the hardworking editors and camera people trying to keep those letters lined up in the face of unbearable stupidity
oddly enough, someone i work with mentioned this to me today so it's a sign i now must go.
are you mad too or any other corporation that does the same? say a record company, a shoe company or a sports team?
true but it still makes my head hurt.
minutiae point. everyone got the point, except you 2
she directly addressed them. your response confused me.
what's most depressing is there are 46% of americans who find this bs inspiring :(
um... over prepared? how so that equatable with under prepped in a pres debate?
yes you write words you know nothing about anything
donald won.
yep. as long as he keeps repeating the same sound bites, he's safe.
as you should. the hell is wrong with people !
she was pumped with ?
i stay off of fb.i don't want to discuss politics with friends. ltrump is mean, cheating elitist.i lived in dads trump village
no. he admitted that he pays no federal income tax because “i’m smart.”
at least youre not a little hoe ): 😂
ha! i read this and thought the same thing.
if everybody does free trade, it's the best. but nobody can cheat!!!
in 10 years, if you don't post ur selfie you will be suspect. violates ur privacy. ?
trump: (intimates assassination) clinton ads: (quotes trump verbatim) trump: you're not nice! waaah! she's being mean to me!
lol my shock is incalculable!
true, but i do miss russert. every time.
exactly!!! lol he looks like he would sing that
should have a comment on this
i respect your commitment to the
you will anyway! i laughed, i cried, i said the word fascist louder than ever before, i booed &amp; maybe hisses once. all good
and the men you want to say yes and no to
ahem, i believe mexico is going to pay for all them from now on. try to keep up erich.
wish you were closer. he's a beauty
oh wait that's cause i muted them all lol bye
you're absolutely crazy. he won't even do the next 2 debates. he got crushed.
they probably broke that ceiling in brooklyn all for
we do our crumby best. 😀😀😀
i couldn't even get in, they gave tickets to only 100 kids out of the whole school 😂
there is definitely crying in baseball. this game is so special.
because he can't tell the difference.
lol, that's all she got, 30 years in government and nothing to show for it. women should remember that instead
of course she does, i almost feel sorry for bill.
yes, in a tweet that was just deleted.
why consider nuclear war an option? zero idea. it's called "mutually assured destruction" for a reason.
or she gets how many millions from radical islamic countries
u could dead suck a dick and die. like hope he haunts u at night
really hates an audience.
prepare for the greatest thing in the world
ima mak that a video how many views do you think that would get? lol
i told her that. got a problem with that???
that's dangerous
ew let's not talk about your asshole god knows where that's been!
he sleeps in a coffin and gains his strength by stripping the rights of lgbt citizens... he'll be fine.
i actually have a headache from it😂😂
convention of states, it is our only hope.
if only moderated this debate.
we're screwed as the usa with either of them why can't people love one another no matter race, gender, or religion
omg you must want to just go home and crawl under your bed and hide. what a disaster for you. how humiliating. omg
not necessarily true. i have no more confidence in the than i do
you really bought that tax return shit?
or maybe i've had panda express four nights in a row and the world needs to be turning around me bc man damn
this is why dems are struggling. a perception gap.
i think anyone with half a brain, knows the only "crooked" person is the one with 500 lawsuits against him. grow a brain
dropped a word in the second graf. believe its "lost"
won only on
well, only if there's no !
very much this. i was more frustrated after than during. jesus. i'm gonna get some ice cream ok good night
just called your san jose store and the manager wants me to bring back a 90 lb and 7ft long box to exchange.
uhh, assuming military/industry counts as making a term acceptable...
3rd party candidate?
bowing my head in ...... and hoping he gets well soon
tell me about it! same here
i think steven hawkins is smart but he's also oblivious to god and the power in which he can't explain 💯
its much more likely were voting for pence at this point… i dont think he actually understand the gravity of where he is (trump)
thanks senator - i lost my copy of 's talking points.
where is the graph about who farted the most!!!
televised debates turned the tide for jfk, but i suppose one could say it's diff circumstances now
to talk finally about his influential role in shutting down the gw bridge?
i already can tell you're too stupid to if you think trump is even a remotely good choice
she was also wearing red and he had a blue tie (role reversal for the day)
"so, shots?" "shots."
false equivalence
i have resolved that i chose her bc the alternative is too scary
new favorite word
exactly, then change your status, k.
maybe he didn't....but he would have....
i wouldn't know how to. but you sound like a man who knows how to do it. done it often? giving lessons?
her answer to that one, tho... 🎤
if you are talking about the ny airports he is 100% correct.
i kind of want the president of the most powerful nation in the world to be overprepared. i was a boy scout.
lmaoooo it's a fact tho...did u peep those cheekbones?
hiding his 'lack of stamina?' maybe he's coming down with pneumonia! 😄😄😄😄
clinton did good..... but she is so dirty.... no mention of the clinton foundation either
it is a real tragicomedy 😱😂
what did y'all think?
california!
omg this made me so mad!
right, the people showing up in your feed.
would you say that hillary won "bigly"?
in my 14 person league i was referring to, my own team screwed me, who knew.
and it will be again if donald gets the job.
i hope not. i hope the undecided heard her clearly. that's what counts. i'm watching and few trump supporters are swayed.
correction. trump sniffed
my synopsis of the debate
says the moron w 4 followers lol
performed tonight like she knew people were looking to create debate memes 😂😂😂
. as the son of a dental hygienist, and the ex-boyfriend of a dentist, her dental work is horrible.
lmfaoo my dad was so tight he returned both of our hats the next day 😂
yep. not nice!
please stay out of politics.
not even a q!
surprising tbh
he's also *very* proud of a lot of things.
what fun is that?
she legit said to him that trump's appeal to black people was good. like, you're telling him?
thanks mom!
go watch my last tweet. i think you'll enjoy it. its to all the people who slander refugees.
no kidding! the mute button is my friend.
considers modern maritime law a european biased construct and therefore revisionist in itself.
school deaths videos
exhilarating indeed!
hey did i subtweet correctly? cuz that was about u ❤️
was waiting for this comment
or there should be a hg wells style "dictatorship of the air". either/or.
the debate was closer to pro wrestling at its best than raw was
agree but predictable. the entire campaign has lacked solid details and any level of conversation with substance.
yeah, the pr pros working for these brands are doing a good job. was great, as well
he actually choked at one point--
in the post debate spin, he did.
if you believe that, i have a bridge for sale.
we met at the dnc among the smell of your supporter's marijuana and petrulli... are you still on the ballot?
i think that trump pissed him off by refusing to answer the questions, like how you bring jobs back.
can you please let her go xd?
i didn't sunday it's ray donavan and the strain plus football
you could have stopped trump, but you had to have your warmonger. you blew it, kid.
oh no.. this is elementary school all over again for him 🤕
oh yeah?! well youre a great human being and that's final!
tomorrow :)
no i am listening to my conscience because i believe women, minorities, gays and non christians are part of america too
but the point is that she is wrong. trump has been saying so for months. give him credit for leading onit
are you gonna call me like you said you would?! is this even your real phone number?!
i had tickets to see him at 54 below but then i completely forgot about the concert and missed it 😣
if deletes the tweet you can reference this screenshot.
you a real one and if someone doesn't see that then that's their fucking loss.
i'd take a robot instead a racist dumb asshole anytime 👍
thank you for proving the fact that people not getting educated&amp;involved is the problem.
..10 generations, in my part of the globe.
over prepared for the most powerful job in the world?? delete your fucking account.
am just battling to stay hydrated and conscious. could this night be worse?
hi, i heard y'all wanted to see a rat trying to retrieve a toy from a pool of water instead of stressful shit ❤️
lol , forgets that he's running for president. he needs to strap on his dick if he wants to be prez
i want to cuddle up next to u in a corner
im an african american &amp; i don't live in hell but if trump were to win we all will be living in a place hotter
my understanding of event sequence: they hidden it first, and then opened it back up after backlash.
we must hope so.
will rebroadcast it &amp; post it online very quickly
poor lester though, oh gosh. felt so bad.
really close now
the one thing i wanted to hear was what would they do about stopping terrorists here in u.s neither really answered the q! 🤔
hahaha you should have been in the group text with &amp; i. we'll add you next time.
that said, hillary seems like the kind of candidate that would have the right people in place to address such issues.
they know what it is. nobody wants to pay any damages again.
i absolutely loathe the lesser argument but one will have office unfortunately. one of them (imo) would clearly do more harm
now i really believe trump will win
we're done with you homie
but spend less time thinking about nato and bad that the 400 pound person sitting on his bed is churning out
ok well in comparison trump interrupted clinton 27 times while she interrupted him 15.
i'm in bed sick &amp; thought i saw same thing. "doc? i need the really strong painkillers"
what do you mean 'overcharge'?
stop spreading this. he called his fam up and immediately shook lesters hand.
your mom doesn't have the stamina. sorry. within
i think your definition of suffering is wrong. you say everyone but i'm fine. so are you. so i'm confused ?
i was supposed to learn something from that?
that might make it interesting. television and politics can't be interesting! or can it?
if only you could see the side eye i just gave
making stuff up like this is literally the reason donald is leading. just use the real ammo
. - a true poll may b 0%. have u noticed blk ppl @ his rally seem like props, maybe paid 2 b there!
someone should remind him that hillary is running not bill.. 3 wives?
i've used the .22 and it seemed fine. just was told .223 is problematic.
lester is a lousy &amp; bias moderator.who cares about obama's birth controversy? lester purposely interrupts trump.
the question really is how much actual substance was said in those words
fuck trump. the president of the usa?
he never said that tho
you'd still catch the gap tho
my fault lmao but the baby in the pic still her own
i need to send you a tub of ice cream! to cool you down.
we are just fucked no matter what, everyone's entitled to their opinion
🤗😘only, the one who really, really physically gets you
hopefully you aren't sooo surprised.....
actually wait no. lol read the article. lmao
yeah i heard the mafia extortion racket he thinks is foriegn policy
kiss my niece gn for me!
it still wouldn't have helped him. ;)
i am so excited for you!! what a first election to be participating in.
that was painful to watch.
or thinks the madness isn't madness as they pay no attention to the bridge out ahead sign on the way to the hell's fire pits
daryl glad you are joining the right side &amp; cheering for my team in october!!
i’ll include . i watch it not for the story but the acting of barry &amp; wells. can’t remember their real names lol
&amp; the central park five
what happened to the red witch? where did she go? did she fly off on her broom?
that makes two of us 🙏
oh please so lame he never voted for any war your gal is the warmonger
the charles barkley part? lester could have been better, but hard to corral trump's childlike yelling
disgusting! rapist and pedophile!
i convinced myself she cared lol 😂 marty's like bitch please... um no..
yeah that's why i tweeted that to let people know
oh thanks man
this such a good question
you on it tonight
was not good 2 see so many personal attacks, coming from both sides. we get it we literally get it
it's sounds so reasonable to be something sir charles would say, lol
he's probably wondering how many words she can type per minute.
he went back &amp; shook his hand probably because was frantically telling him to.
"you've gotta be kidding me! this is fucking bullshit! i have to walk literally 3 miles" 👉🏿
my god, trump said clinton has been fighting isis most of her adult life??? wtf..?
what math? the clinton body count? that's really big numbers; gonna get a calculator, brb...
always won my fantasy games so 🙌
that's because your dad lost. lol!
because it's a lost cause- go home donald trump. you're in way over your square and orange head
this may be the only time i'll agree with donald trump.
the show didn't need to have extra low latency, but what it did demand was multiple bitrates of hd/sd video to serve on demand.
she's a true moron, the only people who won't think he lost are losers like them who think he can't do any wrong
we're just exchanging equal amounts of snark that cancels each other out so it only looks like we're nice to each other.
shamrock part 2! 😂
i just checked our thermostat its 84 in here tonight it was 83 last night
martha and 10
copped the sweatpants thank you 😬
is this a joke?? the murder rate has climbed in nyc since 2013??? really??
we all know the media is bought and paid for by elite globalists. hillary definitely their choice puppet
what a joke.
literally i know😂😂😂
don't make me go through out texts ben
how you goin to hate from outside the debate when you can't even get in?
gets the pen out &amp; starts to write on paper 🤔 do i have an envelope or stamp? 🤔 wats paper - what a strange address lol
was decent, easy to say this cause hill's_billy looks like death warmed over
also disheartening that the bar is set so low that not yelling racist things &amp; being kind of civil is considered him doing well
bitcoin, or stash your pile with a credit union, and just use yer big bank for transactions, etc. but not chase.
remember that bk crispy chicken commercial she did?
yup she would say that😂😂
orange marshmallow.
agreed, the lack of sentiment analysis is troubling. hey guys, engage us!! i can help!
if i didn't have a nice little combo of tonsillitis and strep i'd be there but it's gunna have to wait //:
well if hillary wins, we're fucked.
that was a good statement
that is my hot take goodnight
i have a lot of very anti-hilary republicans in my fb feed, my waco and texas relatives. total silence tonight.
overprepared? i'll take that every time.
haha honestly i didn't look close enough to know!
3p's! presidential, poised,polished - clinton by a landslide
yep. caste &amp; bias allowed mediocrity to flourish. talented poc &amp; women were cast aside.
nope. just interpreting it as both camps partisans are. voters aren't dumb. they can draw their own conclusions.
well think about it..if this is true, he's not in jail for tax evasion &amp; he's a candidate for president. kinda smart
ohhh nahh this is the greatest video ever top 5 top 5 top 5 😭😂😂
newsflash, trump supporters don't care about facts. clinton should have thrown more punches. she let him off the hook
oh don't worry his economic plan will make sure the wealthy pay less taxes because they don't want pay taxes.
i laugh every time i click on it!
it hit my electric scooter and lifted it up off the ground a little and it hit my arm, but i'm ok, i banged on the hood &amp; 1/2
i find the prospect of a trump presidency frightening for our constitution and for our planet.
its been high 90s the past few days😩
this is why white people are scared. lol
no more lester.
trump did enough, especially while questions were about policy to win big. too bad he went with cheap shots,probably told to..
that would be one hell of an expensive biscuit if i were the competitive type 🤓
i think the soonest that would be is the nlcs, if they make it.
i prefer a baseball analogy (indians win divisions!) , but i respect your expertise as always.
smart woman anxiety 🎯🎯🎯
that's it. i don't like how i can't hear the "h" where standard thought is "honesty=infallible= authority
free before 230 tomorrow and all day fri
me when i see your tweets. you're a rapist! no surprise you support trump who is a misogynist
: trump clearly won.
trump is not a career politician like secretary clinton a dynasty of lies, and corruption.
guess she'll have to school you on those topics in debates 2 and 3, if you show up.
omg i thought i heard that too (lol, eyes right to the subtitles)
he really thought 😂
yes would like to see him without and then he can grow it back or not update the look
to be fair, i don't believe trump audibly passed gas. or was that not the intro presser?
cool, thanks for suggestions and checking in! btw. you should record your book for :)
he certainly must be familiar with the dope part of that strategy.
it's the thought that counts💗
is that a jaws shirt with a cat on it?
word. your comment is confusing hofer...
that is pretty fucking drunk. 2016
i never said there are more repubs than dems on fb; just proportionally more than twitter.
he doesn't have a formal title.
have you tried `overcast` ?
both very disappoint to not be discussed. is this a reflection of attitudes?
i love that cleanse.
money make the world go money make the world go money make them panties go money make them panties go
*shots fired*
he's not "leightweight," but he definitely "chocked"
clinton has more balls and brains that trump. you go girl!!
he sniffled so much up there bec he's allergic to the truth
you think he will show up to the next debate?
no=nonsense,just like obama birth issue. her 100%failed record &amp; marxist delusions give 100 other issues 2 use
he probably washes it out quickly also hard water will do it too.
q. how can you fit trump in a shoe box? a. give him an enema.
yes and fantasy, fable &amp; fiction are applicable to the other "realms"--don't be so dishonest.
same it's been too long since we were all together😭💕👏🏻
perjury, obstruction of justice, and public corruption, look 'em up!
or on the subway
my dumb butt! it's already in the dictionary. i need to brush up on my vocabulary.
perfect surrogate to really amplify the "law and order" message...
im waiting for the low 60s and high 50s with a breeze cause then i can wear sweaters😁😁
candidates should have to pass a competency test before they can run!
i just had to let you know 🤓
the moderator is liberal biased. he only questioning trump . he is a disgrace why do they pick idiots.
said he did like how govt spent it. i think trump still available himself of our polic,fire dept waste removal and roads
i mean actually working towards something? pshaw. that's a tremendous mistake.
not what i meant but still right.
i love u &amp; completely agree
ha! i'm sure everyone can't wait for me to shut up about it. forgive me!
except for people who thought trump was unprepared, rude and incoherent. this will b reflected in the polls in the coming days.
i don't deserve this special treatment wyd lys
i mean i typically always take more than you're supposed to too but i'm just gonna be really disappointed when i wake up feeling
there are plenty of legitimate reasons to attack trump. preserve your credibility
true. capitalism is the root of all evil.
cnn insta poll gives hillary a 62-27 win in tonight's debates, and we're all gonna remember this epic fact check
majority watching cnn are for clinton, so poll a joke! fox poll shows trump won debate!
criminals clintons!
plus americone dream is already a thing.
not nearly entertaining nough
i think it's more 90%. he's had 4 bad in what 100 or 200. it's a phenomenal success rate.
the tip off is in autocorrect - it doesn't recognize it yet! and yes.
takes 5 people w/advanced degrees to decipher this nuance? y'all working them brains too hard...
show us those tax returns
he sure didn't do it tonight. he got his clock cleaned by hillary!
people behind the central bank which lends money to the government on interest
they would blame the other people when they didn't even do anything
my friend just started screaming "i hate you" over and over
imagine him putting divergent topics at the bottom of a white board, or saying “deep dive”.
the rouge comment
i implore you to reconsider. he will be a liability in delicate international negotiations &amp; deeply harm safety of minorities.
front and center!! 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽 miss you guys. will be back after this race!
i'd happily take that l of your hands.
lol aw, you could rock it though.
at that time one month!! haha..! 😳
lol copy 😌 you really be treating me like one of ya bozo ass followers 🤔😂 shit crazy 😒💯
nooo favors! in addition, trump laid off the emails.
they wouldn't have let this idiot in to begin with.
agreed ... but let's retire the "but that would be an insult to ..." cliche as it's beyond tired.
that's a joke, right?
i used the word "girl" on purpose to satirically reflect dt's maturity level.
but if you're me and i'm you are you running a fade on yourself
r u talking to urself?
: arrest this piece of crap for anarchy and facilitation of rioting.
scary but true
you're lovely 💕💕💕
take it out of the microwave, there's a fake image circulating around the internet circa ios 7
the only bubble right now is the one is living in
because falsettos!! 😍
lol. what just happened.
they do so they can touch his hand
no your not alone, its mind boggeling how he's lasted this long
well juan if race has to be talked about, haven't you noticed a trend within certain race of people? where they commit too much
that he is now as dependent on a horse race for his job as the rest of the msm...
he couldn't even get a twitter handle without the underscore? what a loser! sad!
try windsor!! 😻
great picture! she was so amazing!
plse did watch debate? trump dealt with moderator interrupting him, clinton didn't.
hillary the best ..
he's a child.
i didn't fact check the spelling.. i just spell words correctly
i wish y'all could have seen what this thread became. it was amazing.
she can't be a president if she doesn't know how american ppl struggle with every day life!!!! she better get her ass out
anyway, this point is handled. increasingly vague rebuttals ignored
6 key moments 1) hillary no stamina2) she lies3)mediasupportsher lies4)30 years of doing nothing good for usa 5 no stamina 6)she lies
it looks insanely close to me.pretty crazy
trump's better off not opening up that issue bc if he does,married 3 times,cheated on wives, would like to "date" his daughter!
just think, at least you'd land a first job &amp; become one of your screw-ball, b1tch-arse, gutter-freak, gluttonous alums.
fuck you and terry...brooklyn, queens, the bronx and manhattan will send ya ass back to 5th ave, muthafucka!
are you serious lester let trump walk all over him, gulliani needs to stop talking
if i don't roast you it means i don't love you
dunno, here you can see the black shift consistent w/ a blue selection for the bricks vs brown for coat
or andy samberg :/
then, i have to commit, literally, myself [!?] to like u would not believe ☆
may say so but keeps mic(military industary complex) high paying jobs with itself..... war econ0my
with what's going on in the news lately, how important is it to portray a black, bulletproof, super hero?
lester holt did a fantastic job tonight!
my opinion is that u shouldnt decide it on one tweet made by someone who might work for her js
one of the first what?
its very clear she doesn't have the stamina or integrity to run our country
why not watch both?
we voted for hillary in massive numbers. worked out great.
of the focus groups are right, she should spoke up to her pre 9/11 numbers
he is one sorry ass little dick ,, russian plant!! he should just delete everything before they get his 1/2 lb. ass!
how does one over-prepare for the office of the presidency?
right?! wtf does chuck think, muthafucka's get voted off each week for being knowledgeable nerds?
tremendous clip of trump interrupting hillary 28 times during the debates and pouting like a child
fuck you you technologically incompetent mexican
amazing how you lie just like your master. soros
why did this happeb
- very nice photog. i really like the pic - had to say good work kids..
james i think her exposed server caused benghazi.
piece of cake
i agree with you 100%. i am tired of hearing about clinton's "likability" factor.
yeah i hope it'll print fine. or that someone caught it.
all 12votes from phone went to u🎉🎉🎉❤️❤️❤️
let me know when were playing h1 boy
lying again in spite of fact debate was televised.
stop. that's not even true
not a fan of her but her restraint was incredible. even when donald kept interrupting.
as a sports fan i am familiar with the loosing team blaming the referees for their losses.
i think on the whole she was definitely less hawkish than usual, but it was by no means devoid of imperialist rhetoric
once in a while, i draw matsu comics and post them on the internet. i have a choro and nyaa-chan scene starting now.
so u complain cus they blocked u back 🤔
but i'll say this: i sat among prominent trump surrogates and donors in the hall tonight. no celebrating and a lot of long faces at the end.
what a shame.
dude, your guy got destroyed by a girl!! i admit there are two more debates, but when he has bobby knight helping him
yep! you're so right, rosie, and it was so weird to hear that in the middle of the debate!
i can't even.... words escape me on this one
thank you grace
i don't know i don't talk to them but ima vandalize their home 🤔
if i may shamelessly self-plug, i did a list of 10 found footage films to check out if you liked bw
for the next debate?
do you really want this election to be about who has better character? i'd stick with the "change" message-both ain't angels
pls u could barely handle the ones they did cover
you're such a hater lol
was it some kind of seizure? why so thirsty? maybe his renal functions failing. or withdrawl from meds.
many people saying that. many many people.
hi i'm the original punk rock mother india gal on a mission. the 🔪😍😭💀🤘🏼
trump the debate, bring back laws and order, help inert cities rebuild and jobs jobs jobs
say what? i don't think you understand my tweet.
lol keep thinking that, the polls say otherwise
i always thought he was on speed. diet pills from dr. bornstein. he would be the healthiest president.
. yes .. too cheap to pay for the courts he uses so much nor the military that keeps us safe and free
did he break a law? if not, blame the person responsible for the tax code.
rudy is batshit crazy
actually, the reality of our country is that it's growing more &amp; more diverse, which racist trump hates.
i wish she would be useful and plant some trees.
look i'm not saying does cocaine. i know people, great people who tell me things. i'm not saying it.
i'm on it. now what?
most ppl can't find america in a map of north america
a million excuses not to release his tax returns because he knows there are illegal info in them plus ties to russia &amp; china.
was her normal mean nasty entitled lying self.dt spoke truth 2power
check my follow up.
and she held back on your own "indiscretions" because of all the kids those indiscretions produced?
wouldn't dr bornstein have discovered this during his extensive examinations?
and whrn she mentioned that dt said 'shd blow them out of water' dt shd have brought-up iran naval incident
what i do is i chew alot of gum and try to sit in a middle seat . that helps it a little for me
omg was today your first day?!?!
how's cinnamon?
goodness he gets on my nerves.
is it too late for us to form a ticket?
they're both idiots and highly racist.
that's gross. no rape scenario is ever appropriate ok
young readers are flooding our news room with support for 11-year-old christopher! 1,000s…
is that the best he can do bring it he is such an idiot how about bringing some substance to the debate
i also managed to come in first place in 2/5 matches despite it being hot as balls! 😁👍🏼
they need to also do something to make a difference, rather then just hyping it up.
that balance notion. shit is real now. very. i think to undecided voters, the only ones who matter, he did not do well
have a good tuesday u all (:
i enjoyed it tremendously.
those feets😍
he should blame it on the bad gear he snorted.
yeah, i sounded like a quite a shithead there. oh, and the lyft ride home took all of 7 minutes. ugh, my life is hard.
potato leak soup is the best! i love how good that this looks!
...want to be disrespectful of the situation. awful and odd.
bc you'd look fire in them tho 😤😤 it ain't fair
hats off, that one’s way better than mine
party of one
it's all insider politics n "favors". it's why superstars like and don't get nominated at avn
thanks chiara! now i need to meet you! ❤😊
this is only the first debate. she was prepared for anything he wasn't. she got under his skin so easily. not fit
well wouldn't your entire adult life be from 18 or 21 years old?
i am betting he'll suddenly come up with a bunch of impossible conditions by tomorrow. not realizing this first one will stick.
trump knows how to ready a performance, a stance, a persona. but he's never had to absorb or present information. no reason to think he can.
lol i know right
and corrupt warmonger hillary who helped kill millions in iraq, syria, libya &amp; honduras is just as fucking scary as trump.
have a good tuesday u all
. he may have lost the election too but we'll let bygones be bygones, right?
you guys continue to live in some fantasy land. clinton clearly won that debate. not even close.
falling all apart. why? it's not fair man. we could have had much better, cosmopolitanism well done. so much went to waste.
i am not sure if this strikes me as a matter of talent. the irs doesn't seem to be as leak-prone as other agencies.
oh no i would never!
i guess you were both doing coke tonight
he performs at finland today
new york city!!!!!
so very sad that you are reporting anything that man says as actual news. i guess you really are part of the problem!
bye elections are always a bye for the sitting government. people wish to get solutions out of governing party.
well whered he go? chipotle? 🤔
linda you hit it right, she is a smug, self serving politician, that was very clear to us, i hope to everyone!
what a dope
what this does is give permission to that 10% of dumb-dumbs going for johnson to break for clinton when they come to their senses
heres hoping the sex is a maze ing
you're doing bad
it handles better than a st with the ford racing suspension and the st wheels
we'll plan it out when we see each other!
um, no it's not. she just killed it as a completely qualified, formidable candidate.
i sobbed involuntarily when he gracefully dropped that one 🙈
lowkey i'm curious but it's gunna be scary
well she definitely wouldn't take a lot of that interrupting.
and god knows how many people have been killed by top secrets held on her unsecured server! she should be locked up!
"they say that eyebrows are the curtains to the windows to the soul of your face." o m g
well, if you see liev, tell him i'm around.
trump is positioning himself to make $ after he loses, judge him accordingly
i miss my old school because they're beautiful people who care!!!
done with the media moderating a debate.
&amp; you called blacks super predators!!! you asshole!!!
ignore him guys. arthur is a conservative hack.
god help us! can't even speak proper english, he just make no sense whatsoever l.
it was never that serious i promise you all these females are temporary but most importantly for everybody
thanks brodie
have a good tuesday u all (:
the right honorable gentleman has lost himself in his verbiage.
i can’t escape my daily work grind with cute anime girls’ daily work grind now
that's why we love em 💅🏼
lol ok i was just thinking that about messaging someone first. just do it. i did it 😂

because he's not fit for president and she is, duh. there's no such thing as being over prepared for president
god bless this family and may the doctors find a cure in our lifetime ❤️❤️❤️amen❤️❤️🙏
missed the point! those are the tax &amp; bankruptcy laws on the book to protect the super rich! wants to close loops
if you think like that then yea.
the world needs you, joe
don't chal this kid. he hits after he loses so your clips don't upload so he gets wins
it’s why i keep looking for things i could make that are applicable to my hobbies so far, nothing
please do lol cause they are so funny
and i ran up to my balcony and watched her leave to make sure she didn't hit my car.
trump missed opportunities he could attack hillary on libya, cyber security, the multiple devices hillary was using.
younger brains, sharper minds
when have i ever had a good day mya smh
stop the stupid noisey helicopters, they aren't helping
i don't think that chelsea manning or edward snowden would agree with this, even if outlets that published them came out okay.
or because it's fertilized with bullshit
stop the stupid noisey helicopters, they aren't helping
yes, someone who will keep the kid gloves on for him..
jonny has an incredible voice that shouldn't go to waste
stfu we both know what the dms said dog shit idiot
idk lol all i know is that i'm unfuckwitable 😂
but oh jeez theres the subplot of the humans family reacting to them being back, and their old friends..... also the police force-
evidently dr stein feels i'm not smart enough to make up my own mind. ::: shrug :::
your surveys are stupid! too generic!
whoever calls me is the real winner lol
clinton wrote her own check for the 11hr testimony...... boo hoo
bragadocious. you know, that super real word.
i have to keep everyone updated! lol
and by heard i mean my roommate had the same thing happen and she got her money back
im home now i forgot to tell you cus i think i'm high 😂
i think that's probably about right
irs and constitution are obstacles for trump oh &amp; taxes. he criticized clinton for not changing law no sep of power for dt. all his
age sex location 😭 were u born in 2005
summer wtf is this
i feel like it's wild logical though specially living in this youth society
of course! hope this helps, because i would be livid if this happened to me too!
don't be stupid - did kim file to run? is she running? no dummy.
if it's in pt, check the air conditioning -- i've finally just rid my place of dms
clearly heidi has a far superior tailor.
i think you need to look at some national polls (bipartisan of course) and you'll realize how utterly ridiculous this tweet is
he said year round. 😂
entire case that dt's incapable of being president, died somewhere on that stage tonight-
you can always tell when a mysterious structure is built in a back yard, or several tool sheds...that's housing.
i dunno, it's only clear to people who think logically. but so many get distracted by his yelling and theatrics
not exactly prepared for tonight. sad!
🔴 next debate bring passion and a list of important issues for a win❗️🔴
mostly it’d have to be a timeout since i don’t think you can pop two pages off the stack

"so how do we celebrate this diversity?" ... by having the sabbath on saturday. for 48 pages. where's…
my concern is equality. alll children having = access to education/resources.
murdered out black? i saw one too &amp; he ripped it past me and took a turn pretty fast.
then why would you be on ls giving your clips before we even report lmao
ooooh hello, luke! you are such a cutie!
more likely go 1-2 in his last 3
who would dick ride a creddy that was never good at this game? lol you dick rode me and my boys back in 2011
yeah don't get them up. that was democrats vs republicans. this is disenfranchised vs politics as usual.
i'll see you next week then!
actual knitting, that is awesome!
not even get played because i don't expect that just not looking to waste time period when it could be simple form the get
we were in a massive recession pre-obama. we are no longer.
if he were president, the united states would be obsidian by now.
i'm caucasian and more depressed than ever that obama is leaving. i wish michelle would run! she's qualified.
i called out today lmfao it was too hot
should be on that debate podium! as much as bernie sanders
she might as well say that he shouldnt be held accountable for anything he says at all.
honestly..... but for some reason most of the drug store ones never looks good on my eye shape it makes me angry
oh so now our friendship means something
let's not talk about being "angry" 😇 that be you all the time !
but alas people who look like me are committing crimes
idk prolly lol 😂
dillon bb19
i always assumed is pronounced like socrates. dog-rat-eeze.
trump won't do the next two debates.
the reign of terror, beheading of king and queen, and suppression of religion all happened under the republic
. have a good night!
isn’t he elected already?
you too goodnight &amp; god bless (:
sure. just give me a heads up so i can move to one of them first. :)
kylee always ruins the moment smh
i know people all want option …
bruh this shit hit me . i usually dont care bout famous people deaths ☹️
they definitely used to be, so that's cool. i didn't need those pics in oklahoma w my grandpa anyway
i'm thinking more henry rollins.
no, she wasn't

wait maybe you can put money on their account then they will play with you. i feel bad for you. those are the kind of
pls love live w/ me....
things you got to do when you suck and no one wants to play with you
or as my mom would call him, "the tangerine nightmare"
👀👀 we'll talk
i still haven't had my drink yet &gt;.&gt;
it's the constitution, folks. everyone gets representation. why is this hard to understand?
yes smug hillary is so smart she buys &amp; intimidates people. she thinks she skated on email .
i have nightmares nearly every night or so, so if tampico will fuck with them, i'm fucking sold
and it wasn't the mobile help desk. it was the same general call centre in india who is spoken to previously.
we talking about haircuts
whow does it compare to trump's 20 or so lies?
i just got back in nyc
i blocked .
omg this is so sweet thank you girl 💘💘💘
we have good experience in design/development &amp; maintenance of websites. please submit your details here:
definitely worth checking out! although, i'm sure you've seen them all, like me! 😊
it's what's happening under the surface that's more worrying!
remarkable they let him go on as long as they did. also wish he'd hire those guys from suits to defend him. they're the best.
lmao no he didn't but this is still a good tweet
the delusion is strong in that one! was waiting for my neighbors to call the cops from all my yelling. 😂
they get into everything.
voting in the us, will be voting for the least of the worst. nobody deserves that.
seems very deflated tonight, l believe that even he agree that trump lost the debate
@ superstar pitcher jose fernandez, superstar golfer arnie palmer. director of gore herschel gordon lowes
i like the way you have faith in something despite rationale is against. so be it.
i just heard you say this in real life and i'm dying laughing
will there ever be video?
o really i see yea because i just checked thanks for telling me man appreciate it .
hahah it's amazing how we never agree on anything. why do we even follow each other?!
submit your details here:
many people say he snorts coke very very much, sad!
a statistically valid poll (versus a nonsense internet poll). hillary won the debate by a mile.
and condescendingly referring to secretary clinton as "her"
we heard there are a few smaller fires, one by glenwood cutoff.
you are certifiably off your rocker. you are a discraze
dan! people will actually believe that lol now jill will use that tweet as a support testimonial
hillary also prep'ed for being sec of state but that did no good. i'll take trump's common sense over her prep any time
where at? 👀 my screen f'd up too 😂
it's still going. glad you were fortunate to keep out of the are and safe ❤️
come play it's fun here. we have grills
i really should 😂
hc was her normal mean nasty angry entitled lying self. dt spoke truth 2 estbmnt power
thats a 3 days interest on america's debts my friend, thats a penny compared to our spending crazies
bro u a dyke nothin u say can top that
you had to ask...
please share these records.
thank you for making such a fantastic flick. seen hellraiser many times.
it's not😂 i rather just eat them tmw then brush my teeth and gooo instead of eating them now lol
its a good game
is having another seizure?her entire case that dt's incapable of being president died somewhere on stage tonight
what!?? you! the most interesting account on twitter has nothing!!! i blame the donald. 😒
hillary clinton is a criminal !!!
you gotta just pray &amp; go to sleep
omg thank you
i guess her real body was just like…brought back to earth by the wish?
learn something new everyday
beautiful portrait!
trump has 1000's of photos with black people spanish etc. hilliary has one with obama . it is old!
which is your fav.?
ohhhhhhh otay lol
2/ here are some good instructions on how to take bug reports on the device without "adb".
laughable poll only one that said she won.. dam you guys are funny
think the donald is s8ck? pneumonia maybe? sniff, sniff. 😉😉😉😉
out of respect 4 chelsea, he didn't. he showcased incompetent h but not
it looked rehearsed between lester and hillary. i would not put it past nbc to rig it in her favor!
she also learned a lot of his weak points. suggesting he's not as wealthy as he claims is a huge one
great piece on and his social/political activism for the palestinian and muslim community❤️ check him out! he's dope!
everything she does is a code to something/someone.
. then again, the one who's less knowledgeable, less professional, and less honest is a white male, so... --too many folks
thanks, and thanks for watching!
yes they were. course afterwards they ran her off before she could b asked questions by press that lester didn't ask. hide hillary
yeah and the rest of us deplorables will be tuning in
i have my taxes done every year and i'm retired, when i look at the final product, i know why i have them done! who cares!
this is a pic from the other side of my mountain.... scary...
boulderfist and crashing storm. rockbiter alone hits like a wet noodle, but with boulderfist, it's badass
you were a fucking disgrace tonight. your not fair your bias towards hilliary and she still lost! your a pos human!
excellent idea!!!!
you're literally doing the same thing rn
definetely! check me out! you can find me on itunes and youtube.
it even prevents the troops for staying too long without review and declaration of war
going to school and majoring in shit that should be self taught only leads to repetitive, dull and uncreative artists.
not like this, he has to be sick and on meds. dry mouth too.
in this and only this
um, no, dumbass, read variety's last article. you lost handily.
it’s funny because he talks like that but also literally in my twitter feed lots of people were actually saying trump was on a ton of coke.
can't disagree if hilary is a thief or not but you can't sit there and say trump isn't lucky
samuel that's very thoughtful of you my king. thank you! :))
shut up foo 🙄
yes! now playing 'the magnificent seven' free2watch just press-n-play,.
tomorrow night we're watching the last two episodes and i'm just breath-taken by how good it is.
it's a clear sign that this really got to him &amp; he knows he flopped.
hey, rox and i'm in excellent company! he blocked me too (well. i think he blocked you... heh).
where do you find "smart beat reporters"?
he made me eat an innocent lamb!! *cries in a corner*
been there. don't get lost on the weird part of the webs. cheers :)
wentz about to dot up that secondary and show that bum harrison smith he doesn't have shit on malc. what you mean?
i'm not a marlins fan but to disrespect someone that passed away on their team is just a low
so beyond excited for you two! safe travels and come home for sunday dinner 🍴 and 💍🏍 storytelling soon!!
let me fill that ass
i love your service. i happily pay to not have ads. but don’t ape netflix just for giggles. i want to see new episodes on the splash.
i guess bc it seems genuinely unimportant in a way?lol
when she opened the door an russia, should have jumped her about the "reset button"…"how's that working?"
aw. i think i saw a couple of clips of hyunjin from that show. where are you watching it from?
life. and i do not trust hillary with my life. this world will turn into a 3rd
still shaky. elite pass rush and elite help behind them. hard to look bad.
that means kitesurfing winds will be on for weds! thanks for the forecast &amp; planning my 2nd half of the week ;)
3/ please, no matter how safe your state may seem, don't not cast your vote because "it doesn't matter"—it really does this year
but i also can't related to adele ands shes amazing and legendary just not my cup of tea. however, chris always delivers.
on line polls don't count.
i worked late- in the middle of watching it now... it's worth a watch. he admitted he hasn't paid federal income tax in years.
asteriaobsidian:hi, i guess im just like mad new but what exactly does live digestion entail?
i know, right?
i called it. said that even if he loses in landslide he would say he won and his supporter would believe him. haha
that notion will not go over with the little guys who get rake over the coal if they don't pay.
you're 12 and i'm 13! right next to eachother🌺
you know damn well you're about to get one stfu
i will!!! :3
is lester working for clinton? bec he was helping hillary by not asking clinton foundation &amp; not interrupting her.
correct, and in good taste, and they have every reason to state it, that i shouldn't get mad.
it was a joke lmaooooo and i'm kinda doing alright, but thanks
nice sweater
it’s still up:
i hope i wasn't being too indirect -- different treatment of suspects depending on what race they belong to is wrong.
hundreds on generals and admirals told me that too.
good will is still looking out of style.
you been to anti-target or something?
his cult fans are hopeless, but hope undecideds see sniffles for what he is.
yeah she was more polished but it's ok. most ppl are looking for honesty , not a president who memorized some lines.
just hang with and
i'm losing my bonnection with the streets 😰
share your treason!
the right honorable gentleman has lost himself in his verbiage.
we'll reconvene, my friend!

it is actually a skill that he founds a counter argument to everything haroon rasheed says
i was going to add that to my tweet but i hate onions in real life 😂😩
good... alana assumed high school and i cldnt comprehend her reply for a sec bc i didnt realize i even wrote it as hs
. i started posting here to vent about shit i couldn't get away with on facebook and it's slowly grown organically from that
i saw that band lucius u tweeted earlier play at my vocal coach's showcase in like 2009 i think...but i'm on that path myself✌😉

we do have very good experience in wordpress. we have designed &amp; developed several wordpress sites.

50 year policy of arming and funding dictators in middle east.failure! ony democracy is israel
lololol is this a rule i don't know about 😂
yes, indeed. i will be thinking of you as i follow the news. beautiful country, but fires are scary and a trial.
in response to this question: "no!" kurt cobain was talented. bieber is just another fame loving celebrity. just saying....
trump literally shitted on black on black and brown people during the end dude is a 💩
it was what we know already donald trump is presidential,hillary clinton will use and say anything even if it isn't the truth to be p
that is a lot of fish.
while honed her fake smile &amp; debate skills for 30yrs, employed 1000s. true "redistribution" of wealth.
found it on facebook. teehood
only because the store closes at 2 and i don't have any beer in the fridge
wake up donald you lost!
hillary defended her tpp stance when everyone knows she thinks its the gold standard.
trump needs to prep, if he loses this against the horribly flawed hrc = bankruptcy # 7
yaaassss cc
the trend is not their friend.
and you also !
i know man😟 but no one is 3-0 so it ain't over
different standards for black americans, or for those of us who identify as black, which the president does.

texans would not be happy about frisk and search, or does trump just pick on nyc? it failed on the block in baltimore.
what did holt bring up to help trump? no talk of immigration, syrian refugees, hils 65%estate tax etc
we are experts in ☞ mobile app design &amp; development services. our pf ☞ email to ☞ leads.com
so trump lied constantly and wants to illegally stop &amp; frisk ppl of color, and thinks "he connected"
lie. it wasn't "his" lawsuit, he did not run the company at that time. shame on you!

oh wow! thanks for what you do!
he didn't need to bring up the emails, trump did. if he actually knew how to debate then lester could've done a better job.
are you fucking nuts??? trumps the warmonger! god you trumpers are backwards and stupid!
nato website: "there is an over-reliance by [nato] on the u.s. for the provision of essential capabilities" - trump correct

i'm confused on why you said fuck trump an not fuck hillary tho
i agree but other than cnn
the fox has a immunity card .courtesy of president obama &amp; ag lynch.collusion and injustice..
this was in response to a question on why trump kept being birther after obama produced birth certificate in 2011.
i'm not sure if it works if career is your motivation, though.
well, is pretty droll, but comes up with some knee slappers.
he was himself,rude,interrupting , an ignorant with his same style an idiot embarrassing and unfit to be president

you've seen the next fallout game, it takes place in the seattle wasteland
what a great great man. prayers for humans family
how did you two get copies? they were all sold out when i looked like an hour after everything happened.
pence said the fact that trump didn't bring up clinton marital problems showed restraint &amp; temperament that'll make for a great president.
then stop telling others how they should look just because it "bothers" you. now you know how it feels
thank you 🤗
yay!! keep going ... don't stop, almost there.🎉💃🏻🍾
georgio,check this out😃 the snake's tail is in taurus. like i said, it is the horn of god's strength!
i just read that no one was hurt 😰
good luck 🍀!! 😘😘
only if they look suspicious..nothing wrong with that. police are trained for suspicious people
oh no, i bet she has them.
is even more dangerous! trust me, look at the me; israel, syria libya. all her fault!
this is how you flex
the lie all the way out on li is od backed up. it's been 20 mins and i've gone 2 exits.

we watched propped-up white male mediocrity stagger from modest attacks by the most qualified woman in history.
donald j. trump is a drug abusing child molester.
literally what happens when someone asks if they can pick your brain.
that would entail study and hard work and attention to detail - this man spent his entire life not doing any of that
the looks on the anchors' faces says it all
besides stern isn't meet the press
dont let her smug personality get to you. keep on the issues. she has none. 30 yr failure
we also did a couple tapings yesterday, one w/ simmons, embiid, saric, and another w/ okafor, noel. catch up here:

this shit is way to cute to be reading this early 😢
and for some pubs that may require short term pain of restructuring business
it isn't a new pic. it was shared when it was taken. popped up in my fb memories. i've deleted &amp; edited her out now
amazing job! please keep bring up trump is more patriotic to russia than america!
second of all, i'm sorry, i'm an average person with an average job and if that's how i handled criticism i'd be fired immediately
i hear everybody liked this guy. wish i met.
no, i up late.
i almost would rather that. at least we'd know the information coming out of his mouth would be true 😂😂😂
you had to look it up?! so then how rich are you?

these are online questionnaires, mostly on conservative websites. they aren't polls in any real, scientific sense.
thanks. was playing with meta. but seems to make most sense to just do it the old way given i have examples 😬
yeah it must be holt's fault that obnoxious dickwad trump came off as an obnoxious dickwad, lol
but. really.
the "we" of humanity has no balance. the "human" side of humanity unknowingly lost in the shuffle rides the backs of children.
pretty sure he interrupted pretty often. he dropped the ball
ahhhh thank u i miss u too 😭💖

fair enough. she should have said, "according to the one actual poll available, trump got his ass kicked."

i'm not a fan of either candidate.... any intelligent american could do a little research &amp; know trumps plans are terrible.
hillary clinton is certainly a flawed human being but i do think she actually cares about people.

trump is first gop candidate to be so brazenly anti-business. its crazy. and is a fucking man child.

maybe they should hold the election in an ecclesiastical setting... to focus the mind.

this is a psa to close friends, acquaintances, family, etc...stop using that word. especially around me
no one should be using that word to anybody, especially in a place of employment. you have every right to hate that word.
actually, if you’re gonna just quit after the gym, the tub’s the place to go. just add water when you’re ready.
i wrote to my local paper. how you ignited the country was first paragraph. we need you!

the drought in ca probs hates you more
to be clear i like basic income (and agree with your sentiment) but don't believe this tech implies it
that perfectly describes hillary who conned the dems, with the dnc, with her lies. its' why sanders supporters reject her.

lucky you... put it to you this way... you didn't not miss one winning pick😃
y'all never brought me back anything
i dream of sodastream
. who told trump to grimace and go on &amp; on about what a shitty country this is and present no specifics on how he'd fix anything?

it is one of the great paradoxes. we never seem to appreciate the inherent tension between trade and immigration.

hey b! got my photo! 2,000 tickets were sold for the event!
he's also made 76 starts the past three years, plus playoffs. he doesn't miss crazy amounts of time
he's another idiot helping trump become president. this entire race to the white house has been stressful.
the finest compliment i received all night
it definitely has an indie aesthetic and indie dev discipline. the hype was bad for it.
yas! and i want to meet zora! field trip to the sheraton this evening?
damn good at it, too!
challenge is that it's beyond current scope of seo knowledge, but shouldn't be. different mindset.

your dog needs to be put on a puppy improvement plan. talk to your hrbp if you need help with it.
it's not just that i think woman are amazing (we are) but trump hates women so much that he will flounder harder against a female opponent.
curious - i always use em as sizing. thought it scaled better. what's the benefit of fixed pt font sizing?
time to start the bill &amp; grant seo for iot academy :-)
jealous. have one for me. wish i could be there too. at least i have my own can of lambo door in the fridge.
if trump were running against a man, he'd keep his cool, he'd be more composed. but the thought of losing against a woman drives him insane.
that's the right way to run a country. we should have public hangings and also no more courts etc, should be sms voting ;)
as soon as we reach the *ber months, christmas music starts
i'd make sure you source specific claims like discoveries being wiped, if i were you.
evidently they still plan base building, although honestly it makes little sense.

so, u believe in calling female accusers liars? nice. nobody is convicting him. but hillary was wrong 2 publicly attack the women
with claims some of those "facts" should put a man in jail, otherwise what you have is slander or conjecture
all of that to say vote and tell your homies to vote too especially in pa, oh, nc, fl, va and co. the rest of the states are pretty set.
