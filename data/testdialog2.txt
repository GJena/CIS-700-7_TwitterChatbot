a white male author yelled at me publicly for being upset by the shriver thing, which was not 1/1000000th as terrible as these other things,

don't be an asshole, people are injured. both incidents are upsetting.
yes,he has shown his liking for putin and other dictators.besides i am not working for you.
fair play because you did yet i completely overlooked it. it's a lesson for me to pay attention to the details, not the drama.
i am omitting the time when lady narborough simply sits as it is beneath mention, do not at me.
i'll try it
didn't even report on this explosion earlier! i heard about it from . mike, please keep reporting because no one else will!
pricey. but easy to visit. great beach, excellent brunch.

i'm still a little hazy on this twitter thing, but is it possible to dislike a tweet? like, a broken heart icon i can click?

thanks mom, you too!
you're right. if you've got a gun in your hand around a cop, you're gonna die.

believe it!
good. it was a dire speech - although a fitting testament to the failed and unpatriotic policies of obama.

really? land in the city that gave the world danish pastries, and that's where you go? lol!

aaahhhh!!! i want to scream like the sound out of 's box, when i hear his voice!!
i guess after that meeting with trump, joe is in love again. joe is another racist also.

nick between the debate, indians &amp; a few rhodes scholars that was watching wwe raw you are the only 1 on my tl watching mnf
what??? that just seems so crazy. like sure maybe some jobs but our entire economy?
theyre up on the website now!! i ordered last week came pretty quickly!
your day just beginning
it's hella funny. trump is a child, and hil is smashing!
i can't. too many layers of powerless anxiety
aren't you staying up for a midnight feast? "are you still awake?" "no. go to sleep".
how many times can you say regulations in one breath??
what have you done h? -t
i think he's letting trump hang himself
agree! reign it in, lester!
this is bothering me so much! let her speak!
he trynna go on break already and shit üòÇüòÇ
can you please come to my work meetings and live tweet comments? üòÇ‚úåüèæÔ∏èüôãüèæüíÅüèæ
30 seconds for hillary to rebut the claims. hillary has a fact checker site at to fact check in realtime. üá∫üá∏
i'm a genius for taping this
tales of an election year gone awry and other stories
30 under 30 is like beaujolais wine. taste it now before it turns to vinegar. we will hopefully age like a 50 yrs old burgundy.üòé
is this weird hand gesture thing also a new york thing???
got to you, didn't he.
give him a sec, he's looking for the taser.
so far he's physically making me ill. shoutout to hillary for handling it well.
they aren't allowed to serve because they aren't licensed for liquid trash disposal
give him enough rope to hang himself
ditto! my sentiment exactly!
he's hilarious
and if you believe that i have a tree of gold in my back yard.
i think i first saw you perform 15ish years ago- serendipity making me smile
i am laughing so hard at this debate
, you're one of the best journalists ever, but you are wrong on this.
fuck you, you've been fighting isis your entire adult life! check my website you dolt!
is he even fucking there?????
in twisted tea currency yes
so true, and he's brain locked on mexico, right now.
this again like i said was the most intense bowls of fucking ramen i ever fought!
he didn't make it thru the first 30 minutes before imploding. the left can now exhale.
not enough alcohol in the world
also at is very flustered by it's hilarious
gave her the double " big league " it's all over for
. that's "yuuuuuuuuge asshole" sir.
she does look good - i agree. but still... i'd be risk mitigating her appearance wherever possible if i were her stylist!
twitter streaming taking it all around the world, alas.
his people are going to eat this shit up tho. big time
not a communist health plan, it's a corporatist health plan. big difference. iraq war is the biggest blunder ever. cost 7 trillion
this is ridiculous. boorish! rude. he is disgusting!
never will...literally ever.
and bush lied about wmd's. they knew saddam didn't have wmd's but they invaded anyway. cheney made $ off the iraq war.
hope she can hold up. rezted
there is supposed to be a clock.
at least it's not on your junk.
you would never know it by looking at the news i follow - all i‚Äôm seeing are ‚Äúthat‚Äôs business‚Äù retweets. both flopping gloriously.
lester getting no respect frfr. he like a substitute teacher.
you can take up time but are u saying anything
i can't vote for these idiots
i also doubt anyone except huge history nerds or filipinos know who he is. i'm both ü§ì
almost certainly
+ eddy kenzo + come bring more difficult performance stylezo let him perform
i spent way too much time wondering what answer i should pick. can't decide.
is trump on blow? he keeps sniffing, can't focus, keeps interrupting and can't answer questions ... yeah.
people are seeing a bully with out a plan. he's been yelling since word 4
apparently not.
so she's going to be sheltered against putin and the saudi royal family? awful, awful argument against trump
oh i see. it came off as different to me. i've had bad experiences with therapists over the years,so i'm always suspicious.
oh you was talking about lex üòÇüòÇüòÇ she wild tho ü§êüòÇ
everything was fine the first few minutes until trump opened his mouth. that's when things went south.
lying, nazi thug.
this is actually worse than i thought it would be.
ill see ya there im moving in with
the more he does the better that moron
does anyone else see the microphone shadows on hillary looking like pit sweat stains?
he's a train wreck.
except trump is coming off like rude a**hole.
its built from the taliban, i believe thats where he gets the time line from
duda struck out ty kelly up
damn it i forgot the apostrophe
really? he's yelling and screaming. she has smiled throughout. calm, composed. pretty clear who is winning.
congrats but he should have better timing if people are going to notice.
engaging with the absurdity of it all/horror-tweeting!
that's trump has lost the debate
esp since she went on about people being hurt, and he jumped in with "its business."
same but goodbye horses
agreed ... it raises blood pressure and makes people want to smoke and eat carbs lol
694 million. i'm about to pull an ivanka
. of course it was.
u think i wear a colored jersey. i root for the truth.
a bigly bubble.
. can you win a debate by not rolling your eyes? or calling trump a douchebag?
donnie calls it "business." if everyone gets laid off, he can hire peeps cheaper!
"i'm the best at getting audited."
i literally went to twitch to check like 5 minutes ago
because this is america and we are full of bad choices :/
marco rubio is probably enjoying the karma.
.'s faces though . üòÇ -
i wouldn't be with her if she was the only one running. have no idea why she just keeps smiling and laughing! she's a moron!
are you kidding?
where your tax return is?? do reply to this question!!
are you blind? he's acting like a fucking phyco
holt: "um, audit doesn't prevent you from releasing your taxes" trump: "i will do it as soon as lawyer says ok. or cuz her emails"
he's playing to his ignorant sect of people in the usa that buys his crazy rhetoric -.-
he has words, he has the best words
his actions are allow'd for ratings tv, this behaviour is totally irrational for public office.
like nobody rly finna take him seriously come on now
he is in his feeling now.....
don't they all do in some form or the other?
wth!!!! no!!!üòñüò°
"as soon as the shredding - i mean the auditing - is complete"
they deleted it. the internet has infinite memory, though!
omg now i have to look for it , didn't even realize lol
considering how many times she interrupted sanders in the primary debates, it is odd seeing her on the other side.
you are so right
yes indeed! made for snapchat
he's still trying to navigate his drive way üòÇ
it's called mansplaining and he's pulling the white male privilege by talking over her and interrupting...
lol seriously! today we were really nice
definitely, &amp; i'm terrified
that's why i don't reply to the people's dumb tweets because they think they're right too
old saying " never argue with an idiot they will beat you by their experience"
you should really do actual research not trump quotes and fb right wing pictures
lol i already have the rocky theme in my head. i'm ready to box lmfao
just like this presidential debate. &amp; you never know who we touched . üíï
kayne doesnt look like a bad option at this point
"that wasn't even a bad story"‚Äî
trump paid no taxes. trump donates nothing to charity, trump in league w foreign banks -liar !
always been a fan of that word‚ò∫Ô∏è
my car broke my xbox
bragadocious is a word?
not sure what this has to do with the fact that both debate participants are reprehensible human beings.
she's been doing a good job of keeping him on the defensive...ü§îüòâ
. claims we wouldn't learn much from his tax returns. so why has he yet to release them, hmm?
lol i get it.
its about time this country had someone who knows something about money running it?!?? how dare you
is that a word ?
i am so confused lmfaoo
key word maybe!
he can't control himself when anyone impugns his money. anything but that.
well, i mean he did say $14 million investment to start his business from his father was a "small loan" in 1975...
you're not drinking enough
it was on sale. it's usually $3-$4üëçüèæüëçüèæ
he doesn't pay any taxes why is he complaining?
i wondered the same
laguardia airport is the worst!!
huge congrats - awesome to work with / well deserved!
hey what's your take?
what about ord, though, what about ord?!?!?!
no you don't it's not prettyüòè
"maybe because you haven't paid income taxes in years." yassssss
sadly i have to agree.
a spoiled one. he's ridiculous.
to be fair lga is absolute shit. worst rated airport in america and it's not even close
it was my pleasure to be in it, but thank you for including me &amp; also the my applause to you üëèüíôüòòüòò
but how can anyone know for sure???
? i'm failing at hashtags
it's so hard traveling in private planes tho
i'd like to think i'm smart by not trying to get jailed by the irs so i pay taxes
has taken no responsibility for the results of her hacked email server.
to bad it was spent by bush administration , do some fact check
just sharing our kids' comments. just did for hillary too. equal &amp; balanced. no bias in our articles. not trying to offend!
lol thank you wes üíï. i have somin new to show you from today lol got my purple back.
braggadocious is a word :)
it's terrifying.
basically. smh...lol
yeah, i've flown through hanoi and quito. lga is luxurious in comparison.
. this is awesome!! finally hilary
. reads on not paying his workers &amp; 'stiffing' people out of pay .
isn't that how you started the shop? you're being hypocrital. plus a wall is like a big ledge if u wax it.
i am following the twitter comments, many of which are great, and will likely watch the entire thing later,
missed the chance
o hare i find to be passable
well now we'll find out with their match about to happen in a couple of mins lol
yeah, and he just said his tax money would have been squandered too. admission of guilt, no?
you gained so many followers from his tweet oh my üòÇüòÇüòÇ happy birthday haha
it was a joke...
it is even more shocking that half of the population think he is suited to be president. we are living in idiocracy the movie!
yeah? is the wifi wack?
ugh, this hurts my heart.
because i smoked pot and read dc comics.
i don't worry about making tweets, just wait for you to do the heavily lifting and i retweet ;-) &lt;3
... let me just zoom in on that for ya
also jfk is mad nice lol
they are loving it. this is their dream.
i was actually expecting him to make a joke about obama golfing on his courses
why does cedrick alexander sounds familiar
how is he not part of the status quo, which is governed by money?
"wrong." "it's all words. it's all sound bites." -
so sorry to hear that. i'm glad we get to see the real t
i was audited last year. nys accused me of not spending 8,000 dollars my senior year at nyu.
this sounds interesting! i want to take a look at the book on friday if okay with you!
where do i get reservations so i can throw up on the lobby carpet?
less in favor of "don't pay your design /construction team".
sure, but i've really gotten into terminal 5 (live music!!)
you and i are listening to different debates, respectfully. it's not about punching, it's about facts/lies.
mad shade to tsa. i mean i don't like taking my shoes off anymore than the next guy but come on
literally tho
oh right she met joyce pensato lol
gaslighting. projecting. deflecting. textbook sociopath behavior
guilt. guilt on you zack.
so is "the donald" saying that americans who pay their federal taxes are stupid?
h, you pay zero taxes - money laundering through your foundation.
it'd be a bad strategy to go after his base, though, yeah? more sensible to target that elusive swing voter?
or sniffing a lot and gulping water.
launching what?!
good idea for those who can stand hearing open his mouth. i cannot.
idk i'm pretty down with lil john and missy elliot
she blundered delivery. great line. bad sound bite
. "let's talk about race." crowd at gets even more lively
to be clear, this needs to be discussed, and i hope it gets plenty of time. but trump is gonna fuck this up so bad.
the world moaned.
not to be sniffed at
the part-2 meltdown hasn't happened yet.
i'll release my tax returns when releases the 33,000 emails she deleted is not condecending
that hashtag is everything
he also said that not paying tax is called smart.
oh lord! lololololol üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
yes. but i also realize privilege of living in usa and paying my fair share. he makes millions, pays nada. that's patriotic?
look in the mirror loony...
if trump &amp; his rich pals paid taxes the past 15 years, we would have money to do that
the new sunset?
hillary side steps the email question, she lied.
but its the pro-vaxxers, you know, we * that are rude, not the calm &amp; decorous vaccine-questioning**
i'm not ready for this. i can't take this
my impression is that she has trump on the defensive.
"look at charlotte, the city i love" yeah sure donald üòÇüòÇ
nope. people like you who vote for people like trump who make those self serving laws. that's how that works.
actually loves this book &amp; is a gaiman fan. was a little out there for me so i abandoned it. üòÅ maybe i'll revisit?
she won the coin toss i guess that means all night long *shrug*
ya, seems to have gone down when he sent ppl there... v weak.
oh shit you're right!!
bc she is not smiling. the donald sounds like a moron but she gets criticized over this
he on that powder.
yeah, duh lol but you don't get the principle?
time to join a credit union!
well....they are w-o-r-d-s with l-e-t-t-e-r-s
how's studying?
i've met alot of white kids that are lowkey republicans but they're usually kids who are in the industry due to nepotism
report, then block.
"african-americans are living in hell" and "need more law-and-order", is now, as it always was, an appeal to white voters.
law and order? how about sensible gun control
what are you watching?
roll a d20 for next outcome.
lets sell him
check your dms
both. my house is super big. i need marble everywhere.
üåπ's are red, üíô's are blue....
cause he's nervous as hell. dry mouth, hence the sniffles.
you not even from here, "african american communities are being decimated by crime." shut up.
they teach u that b/c those are the cpas ppl will hire. that doesn't make it right.
dude i was so hyped when i saw his promo!!!!!!!
blowing the racist dog whistle.
nothing because is the most incompetent company on the planet and has an outage on my block
can he even be moderated?
our tweets on this are kindred maybe we should be writing partners idk just spitballing
. white people don't shoot people!!!! wait!
or maybe like a shitty version of gre vocab flashcards?
you're fucking awesome
beautiful segway combination. both solid blows. can lester stop the fight at this point by ko?
it wasn't but i've moved on to the next topic thanks for playing
i am dying laughing, my brother does the best impression of that
but not on equal levels tho hillary is like a tv dinner trump is like melted black licorice off a hobo booty
just the laguardia part shit is so behind
where's marco right now
she seems energetic.to me.
i feel bad for associating orange lizards with him but he's can't be equal to humans.
or just read twitter
. i love you, the dictionary
plantains (green or ripe) =\= bananas (green or ripe)
lmaoo ard it's not that deep üòÇ
out of the hands of criminals
me too. and that they resent smart women, so her reason works against her. this is my fear.
trump said during the debate that buying houses when the market crashed was good business!
sorry, i had to set plans in motion when i saw that he was serious about running for president. i play no games
she's such a liar
this is how i know you're streaming this on the internet. wait a tic.
there's been tons all night..."biglsy"
i know, right?
omfg gangs of new york
why do they even have an audience?
he almost failed me but he taught me well
ill be the priest @ the wedding
hillary clinton is right and donald trump is wrong
that's what a president does control things in a calm manner
and you need to develop relations in the communities by having a cop personally stop and search each and every one. lots.
"police judge" your welcome networks.
i'm not a kid, and i was meeting pedantic nothingness with pedantic nothingness. have a good night.
lmfao i fucking hate that argument! so untrue
exactly one year ago i got on a plane in venezuela, and lower in new york, i thought i was in another world! üôÑ
he's wrong. he's wrong, and she's right - she spoke about the beauty of the black communities she's seen.
excellent tune kadondo
did you miss his bit about china?
and giuliani was the worst ever!!
cait ive been bumpin to this song all weekend, i love marc bassy
at least they didn't disparage your height!
that was a doozy!
disgusting people may vote for her!
it's not gonna get any better if that racist wins the presidency
-- the first relatively free election in kashmir happened in 1977, reflects the influence of jp too
not trump i hope
bruh i was at slander &amp; i said "this opener is trash i can't wait til slander comes on" &amp; this girl was like "wait who's that"
i feel this on an emotional level irl rip ****
well...calm, at least
that's also yet again hellariois. we need to put guns in the hands of law abiding citizens to shoot back then crime retreats
immigrants are protected by labor laws. illegal aliens should be deported. they are not immigrants
come home dustin
he need his shot of cocaine, he's a freaking paedophile that supplies models w/drugs &amp; pimp them to d0uche bag rich new yorkers.
how is she delusional
sadly it might to the people he thinks he's speaking to. :/
the more money we spend oversees on military the less goes to the community, perfect breeding ground for the red army
she had to learn to do everything bill did, backwards and in mom jeans.
can we please revisit the conversation about laguardia? i fly out on wed. and would really appreciate a bar inside the terminal.
that's exactly what i was thinking.
youtube live streaming should work in sydney
i don't know and it is driving me fuckin nuts
if it is 60 in iceland they have geothermal springs by the beach so the weather is perfect üò¨
i've already depleted the beer and i'm still way too sober for this
and sexism! don't forget sexism!
what if there is a civilization out there in which baby vomit improves the value of a thing
this is going to bang (pun intended)
wait what does that mean?
if trump wins it will be the fault of hillary voters who picked hillary over sanders and the dnc who rigged the election against him.
omg so lucky so your seeing him three times in manchester
let's hope more and more women feel that way.
that actually looks good lol
burn, mrs. clinton burn!!!
i didn't make that mistake
he needs a spray bottle full of water for whenever someone interrupts or goes over time.
amazing how twitter has changed things.
gurlllllllll i was thinking the same thing
honestly jordan i would rather you be president
oooo i'm sorry you have an opportunity to move back lol
that's cool what rows are you in
so... par for the course?
republicans would be worse but u cant turn a blind eye to ur own party's problems.
and shes still kicking ass.
not even he knows.
you have an egg as ya profile pic hold this l
nothing to do, compared to the fascist dictators of venezuela, this "man" is a child playing to 'the little house'. üòÇ
what's a troll bot?
at least hillary is like "police need to be retrained &amp; need to work with the black communities. their churches &amp; businesses"
it's a good thing i'm drunk cause i understood that
i mean, that was never a reason when i was in law school ...
let's face it some are so repugnant !
when trump speaks it's like when a 6 year old is first learning how to put some verbs and pronouns together
maybe im sleeping but i wasnt aware the illegal gun owners are gonna see new laws, just drop their guns and obey
adverb verb noun noun --mind blown
looks like it kept falling to me.
i nearly spit out my rose üç∑
i had a bet on it and i'm currently losing üôÑ
at least he's liked african americans for the last little while
vote for hilary though
would anyone ask for donald's birth certificate?
certificate was produced he spent another 4 years trying to falsify that as well. he's a racist, ignorant bigot and i'm pissed !
but in the end she's just feeding lies and giving you what you wanna hear.
sorry to hear
i don't do attacks on people's appearance, no matter what i think about their politics or policy positions
okay. wow. holy shit. that was phenomenal. üò©üëèüèæ
"over the pass - ah - little while."
bro the conversation is resolved.
more like nonsensical idiot liar year that much better pos
nah, we all bored to death.
oh, that! score?
why didn't you get george bush jr., sr., clinton, reagan to share their birth certificates?
:-* thanking god
oh wait can i like my own tweet?
because trump accused the first black president of not being a citizen and the subject of the debate is racial tension.
think about what pence is doing right now‚Ä¶ slitting his wrists? banging his head against the wall? drowing in tears?
good, it better
and i'm kinda happy to be australian
yeah def. not perfect, but pretty on point. dts tryna pretend he's not racist but he literally retweets white supremacists so
how the fuck do you know what i'd do, ? i believe in this country, and loathe that greedy assholes work the system.
i'm a realist. but yes we can all "hope" üòâ
dt sniffs,,,guilty
tru but i love so many people that are just not on the same page ..... ugh
it got worse because of him
yes and i didnt mean to get assissinated
alright im trashed
holy shit lol ‚Äúwe settled with no admission of guilt‚Äù as a point of pride. amazing.
fire up the dimensional shitter
why would move his companies out of if they r only paid 30 cents/ hour? as he calls it i bet
yea its called systemic oppress. we should all be checking our own biases. thats her point.
we can agree tide has turned, yes? he was comfortable talking economy before, not so much now
of course you agree with h, you are getting paid by h campaign to run to take votes from trump.
of course brotha
no doubt, this is the quote of the debate
lester suck he is bais
mr. sniffles is bothering many of us
wheres my cookie
grimm starts january 6th
i'm all good thanks. hope you are well too!
it's true. they were marked "c" for colored.
she needs a backbone against him, i need to teach her how to be a polite bitchüòÄ
. better trump line would be "i was so racist that you went to my wedding!"
exactly... lmao only way to get ahead in this country is to educate yourself, take risk and work hard man
i disagree he's counterpunched very effectively
or sneeze cocaine.
so you're saying that all blacks / latinos are criminals? actually it doesn't work.
gun control is the only plan has. it won't work because criminals will always find a way to get guns!
right. they're employees.
reagan tripled the debt in his presidency. clinton paid off most of it, with money left over.
hardly know holt is there...
we're getting a promo ot for sure
right! he let in minority multi-millionaires so he's definitely not racist. guy is such a clown!!
anything about rec and parks or cbd-managed downtown spaces getting closed to public for party rentals when so little parks
she needs to stop this, i respect the president bullshit. her 08 campaign was nasty and racist.
even if he loses it will embolden the next generation of trumps.
hit on taxes/birther what about her he emails? he is unfair
i aint gonna mess with my mom when she changes the channel unless i wanna die
same. it's like watching an on field injury. you gotta know what's going on.
in all seriousness there was never a grain of hard evidence, it's all circumstantial
i wish jon stewart was still doing the daily show. he'd be on this like crazy
murder in nyc is down 4.3% and serious crime is down 2.67% through sept. 18 compared to the same time last year.
thats gross
hill shd give it back harder and get under his hair
lmao, that's him
fact check me
but why does he always have her answer first?
it would be a good idea to do such articles every now and then for people like me trying to get into comics üòÅ
nope, that lucky yet. needs to nail to the wall &amp; cut off his tiny little winnie.
this is me right now lmao all that is different is a bottle of titos
2/2 i'm glad the safety team at uber is (not) doing it's part. license plate 7npw790 black mazda if you care (üòÇ)

help you in whatever department you need.
donald trump loves to tell us how great he is. he looks and sounds crazy.
listen i don't have to prove anything to u, i know what blk ppl r saying re trump, so u have your opinion and i have mine
i was thinking just that
watching in a bar. for efficiency
u win a prize of funny. it is a six pack of pbr. due to inflation sorry.
thanks, walnut. being down can kill a cow if down too long.
listen to the demagogue i was just endorsed shut up djt you are so full of yourself
thanks for leadership
did he say ice?
his son is unbelievable with computers?
trump's jokes got a lot of laughs in new york (amongst mostly democrat crowd) -- not sure it sounds the same in california
- he cracked the case...a 400 lb person sitting in their bed hacked the dnc ü§î good grief!
"yasss queen the gag is to drag hunty the tea is flaming hot"
thanks for the retweet!
hit on taxes/birther what about her he emails? he is unfair
talk about endorsements when you're clueless about cybersecurity...and hack back...bring up 10 yr old
when he has to speak beyond 30 seconds he's screwed. scrambled gibberish.
13 love cousin!!!
after some reaserch i noticed his appearnces are very limited, they are memorable however
pretty sure he's making a nerd joke
didn't work in south africa once mandela passed. sustained, fairness, equality &amp; equity works best.
üòÇüòÇmy sister was there so she took it for me thanks baby
in fairness non of those things spontaneously combust... or are ridden by twats! üòú
will trump bring back dancing hamsters? i bet he can bring back dancing hamsters.
the one instant of the night of few
i can send emails too.
misspelled words belong nowhere near debate night
ok this is funny liz
i think that's a valid point. racial bias is not just a police thing everyone in the us has biases.
yes! she does this shit all the time üò´üò≠
dirty trick tryna keep me sober
the highlight of tonight's is the twitter feed :)
maybe it was ren?! who says it was russia!
here you go. hillary's guy blumenthal started the birther thing. so go complain to hillary:
i think he is sipping some alcohol not that he needs alcohol to act stupid
trump (cont.): we need to figure out the cyber. all the cyber. cyber, we have to do better. i have a son. he's very good with the computers.
i own property in sandwiches and i can vouch for that.
he just did a sound byte for them: "they're beating us at our own game: isis."
this is perfect lmao
yeah i think so
your talking about what i said and nothing about what he said your the one not listening
the next version of jetpack will protect cyber
ah you should text back
sorry- overload. fugelsang says fact checker hung himself.
chestnuts roasting by the dumpster fire ‚Ä¶
trump's son will solve cyber security. big relief to those of us in silicon valley.

the fact is that she claim is her ally but went against him hard in of 2008
american intel has never confirmed the russians were behind the hacks. your remembering the spin that came out of the dnc
more people need to at least be talking about this more people in our generation need to care again
i have two choices right now and i think i chose the wrong one.
does the sniff).
yep, three more to go
omg he just did this again but he shouted wrong like 5 times

trump is an embarrassment to our country - he speaks like a 2nd grader
all he's done is talk absolute trash this dude has 0 idea how to run a country he's a business man go back to doing business
you've come a long way since earlier in the year. ü§îü§îü§î
none of that was your fault. its the law to have your dog on a leash :-)
"a very against police judge." , you and are killing me! please ! !
going to get from library asap!
i'm listening to this the entire time like
stop blaming bush for what you and obama have done. you're pitiful...
i heard big 400 lb fatties hunched over scary computers may be there
hang in there...it's almost over...right?
we can't catch a break my dude. üòî
i broke down to and went to wild: rice and bread
the need for a commercial break. i'm outa beer
turn the volume up lol
actually convinced can see the future at this point.
have and use on new systems, but wish it wasn‚Äôt chrome only. :-/
all i see is pointing fingers and no real solutions
democratic, sure. (or ‚Äúmodern‚Äù, even). but i‚Äôd suspect there have been some long-term alliances in human history
you don't have to vote.
if it wasn't so serious i would laugh. he is talking about omorosa and her family. smh. he is so racist he becomes blind &amp; deaf
he's been asleep at the switch for sure
the house of representatives
lmfaoooo why my 7 year old cousin speak better than him ‚òïÔ∏èsip this hun
&lt;-mean lady will start ww3, hrc is in no position to defend us vs. cyberwar.
millions of people think it is reasonable. leaders need to take ignorance like that head on. she should not have let it pass
100% forgot there was a football game on
i just want obama to be president forever üò´üò´üò´üòîüòîüòî
i know but she's still an old lady
i can probably write it
forever my fav üòçüòçüëèüèΩ üíñ
i support this
ha for sure. it's amazing any candidates lie nowadays. then again narrative wins. sigh.
for how much he loves the city he certainly loves bashing its businesses/politics too.
buddies go way back..
i know i suggested she wear the robe from the show
i have close friends that truly believe trump is a good candidate and a good man. it blows my mind.
you got comcast? lol it's on the big channels
how about undergrads?
congrats babe
apparently not. (also, i love you!)
yeah internal indeed! the moderator is a joke!
this is a sick burn for service workers everywhere
what did they do
you're killing me üòÇ
somebody tell me this is a joke
best fact checker i've seen of the many circulating, delightfully thorough
it's actually stunning how she can do it. shows she has tons of restraint cause a tone else would just be going nuts.
wait you were going to watch this "debate"/circus totally sober?! üç∑üç∏üç∑üç∏
(well and i had just gotten done talking to my brother for 45min)
. did you call the other day?
you mean they better off due to the electoral college**
bout to fearlessly dive into the unknown.
there you go again, it's all words
i will. will call him a douche. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
well it was v thoughtful of you tyvm
why come here to take our jobs when they can work for trump back home?
all he talks about is money
ain't that the truth
one day you'll look at nypd's owner data. but i know facts mean nothing to some
so that's why that one time i thought you were donald trump :&gt;
is that in the fact checker?
i work for suitsupply as a salesperson. best to come in and have me fit you.
its gonna be bad either way but i just can't stand hillary hahah
because donald won't shut his mouth. lester needs to interrupt his loudmouth more
if only she had been a better parent when it was an infant
steve can i come to canada i'm scared i promise i won't ever make fun of the leafs ever again
can someone get him a straw so we doesn't smudge his lipstick
immigration and customs enforcement
'preparing' to be potus ? preparing to not hack up a lung or......some 'other' happenstance.
ugh same! wish you were here!
this is too important not to do so
: voted for iraq war.
you'll learn soon enough
the insanity on the screen is terrifying.
mine is not clear. but i do need another glass
definitely a dress rehearsal.
so ignorant so stupid just like the rest of the ugly deplorables filled with lies and hate you are disgusting
omg ive always thought max was part nebelung!!!
doing a lot of repeating tonight
sean hannity is racist just like trump, and would say any thing to get a republican elected.
i did that shoulder shake in litigation settings with male attorneys
it's central!
damn i had al bundy in the pool
also can we all pls stop saying hillary is even remotely as much of an "evil" as trump
i'd like both candidates to name sources. both have "read something the other day." ‚Ä¶
, whoa! minds synced. both sent at 10:23 üò±
haha. i feel for that poor woman.
h, you can't be trusted with emails. with codes neither!
wow. that is what implied means. i'm tweeting this slowly for you.
oh, i don't think that's the best example of racism; he wouldn't have respected any moderator.
speak softly and carry a big stick- teddy roosevelt
i did i took the top the doors and the other top off
optically trump is coming off like a rude, unfit, unprepared a**hole: frequent interrupting, talking ovr hrc/lh - bad optics!
as far as i know, trump is the only candidate that's a defendant in a child rape trial.
o !!! right?!
h, you can't be trusted with emails. with codes neither!
his tiny little finger.
you sum it up beautifully.
she wants to be prez -she has to fight back! she's letting him roll all over her.
show the whole quote
yes, i don't know why i'm not watching something else. maybe when i finish this beer...
explains why his website went down
so true because it would be worse than it is now.
honestly i don't blame you my country is turning into a joke because of this candidate üòï
a great perspective during the debate!!
all that was a bunch of malarkey!
hey hey hey! no fighting!
and serious gun control.
he is doing a lot of the talking.
please and thank you.
there is no moderation.
lester looks like a high school ref trying to control a manchester derby.
he's lying.. nobody believes you even your family trump you are dumb!!!
silly, he knows more than all the generals that ever generated.
hey hyd all the info on the beats are here
that's great!!
he is literally this character right now
i'm seething
yes! so many words, so little substance!
are you going to random house open house on dec 15
i'd listen to howard stern over sean hannity
that's exactly what he means...facts
she destroyed him. period!!!
if by "well" you mean screaming incoherently about bad people, his winning temperament and climate change being inconsequential.
yes ...who do you think ran the country while bill was with his interns ?
peach with an r üôèüèªüò©üôåüèª
we're practicing for the future.
clearly has had the educational system fail them
when you only have conservatives voting that's the result you would expect
intelligence and honesty are important. action isn‚Äôt a debate tactic.
so how would you like people to specify when they are talking about those folks in those cities?
he will come back with some scary scenarios
i have 100-1 odds on .....there's still time.
me literally 100% of the time
water watch as hillary said, "words matter when you run for president"... trump takes a swig
that's a fire line
is there a vote on the weakness of moderation
he didn't destroy himself. but i don't think he won anyone over. so it comes down to organization.
and he doesn't answer the questions!!!
tom brady doesn't rehurse he practices.
dt is a scam artist and when he shows his taxes you will find the you are paying his taxes
if you two need to leave the country you can come to me üíú
he is a freaking jersey. trump, you cannot buy class
but just one more out!!! tribeeeeee
how would you know something like that? and with all due respect both w bush almost took us all the way down. obama was nextüòê
tbh rise by
exactly the more he speaks the more he entangles himself (foot in the mouth disease)
is just not doing a good job moderating tonight.
hats seriously sooo depressing just thinking about it, money just washed awayüíîüíî
that's not a secret, he literally said it during the commander in chief forum, but no one picked up on it. so sad. üò¢
his mansplaining and male privilege is killing me!
trump actually doesn't seem to have an understanding of how alliances and trade deals work
which, once again, probably will not matter in the least, but a candidate did have to assure allies across world of mutual defense.
than* but idk about that this debate is pretty rough
you're wrong! if he does die, he's gonna be brought back okay *ugly cries*
it's also anti-liberal. disagree, sure. never say the criticism shouldn't be made.
hillary to trump: let's see you handle my old job as sos and then let's talk about who has "stamina"
h, you are responsible for death of 4 americans in . you are not qualified.
chill lmfaoo u switched it up you told me in person tuesday
great q. will get back to you a bit later after i convince my toddler to sleep. üòâ
scope out !
hillary is a meanie!!! - donald
but of course, he denies saying it. like the iraq war.
to be exact, union that workers belong to did--ice itself can't endorse. first time union's endorsed anybody.
i wish you guys would express your feelings more...ü§îüòâ
can't believe it's par for the course with this asshat
lmao i just said the same thing. trying to parent on stage
i get it, neither candidate is ideal for many of us. but who is gonna screw us least?
i hate si much that this election has brought us to the point of voting for incredible corruption vs complete incompetence.
delete your account now liar
i'm trying to decide who you support by your tweets, but they're very cryptic...almost poetic! (sub dad for daddy, better ring!)
if i only watched or or i might believe that. unfortunately, i and most millennials know that she's shady, bruh.
well she has great stamina to keep a straight face throughout this lol
i'll take down hillary if you'll take down trump üëç
u hav to get this out on fox or lizette. holt made same mistake
honestly, i'll fuck his whole day up. i'll go off for years about it.
i feel ya, but keep in mind that one of those two will be prez. and if i had to choose, rather it be hillary
and i'd be on the corner singing some sam cooke
this is also how i feel about paula abdul when she was on american idol
it's just the beginning
unless he drops out, he will. so i'll take that bet.
tru and they atleast win
why are you in my mentions
this is gross
i really wish people were not wasting their time watching this dumb debate featuring 2 idiots.
not according to . thought he looked great and had substance.
what day are the services?
exactly!!!!
love me some . need to switch to her!
your not the only one, glad it ended
üò´üò´ that's still a tough choice nfs üò≠üò≠
please also congratulate me for not hitting a car on my bike today and not shooting up a liquor store.
and singing "half breed"?? üòÇüòÇ
my cousins work there!!!
so why didn't you pivot and bring these things up?
i cant wear contacts ill lose them
yo that was hilarious! she's like, i have literally talked to every country you just mentioned!
stop the hillarity!
hilary clinton is not wearing her american flag pin???? she suppose to be the leader of our country.
great track
hands down, she won
well.. lester lost.
i come for the snark but totally start for the rhetorical critique
also, howard stern
it was excellent
hillary is an awful debater.
he's a germaphobe...he doesn't like shaking hands
too high a price. (but i will show you more baby pics.)
üò≥üò≥üò≥ that went by quickly
fatties will be executed every tuesday's at 8am eastern standard time
and nothing about deplorables even though it was set on a tee for you. choker.
o'malley nailing it.
üò¢ crybaby in chief. hillary spanked you hard. go blow your nose, loser.
the 1/2% and banks rule this world. period.
so she called the restaurant and they told her they cancelled my order for a completely different reason!!!!! okay. bye.
said he'll bring manufacturing back 2 us but he manufacturers all his goods in 12 other countries.
i pretty much went broke buying them but they'll be worth it.
so happy it's back this week!
wow whatever
i can go on a whole rant but you're really not worth my time honestly, grow up man pay attention and stop being so self centered
someone missed the debate.
you also can't support racism and say you think everyone is equal. can't have both.
the cleave got me actin republican. i can't even lie.
awh this is so so sweet!!!! i love u jenna üíò miss u so much
isn't this nuts?! talk about it on talkshow . we want to hear from you.
probably because he doesn't know the facts
don't despair yet. i think you read this wrong.
..and that would be because you hate this country? and christ, maybe?
absolutely the best bbq. had some on sunday.
they are not troubled by it they have their criminal justice system to deal with that plus where is the correlative things that created it?
or just anything about the debate
omg he might see a poor person.
i will not be voting 4 clinton. don't stand for something you'll fall for anything.
not even. trump wore hillary down so much that at the end the only thing she had on him was that he was a sexist.
here come the excuses! this is hilarious.
i hope you are correct
true and true
yeah now you can just flat out lie.
..hope so sis. i wanted to see a fatality tho. trump still won that debate regardless
again "assertive women are judged more harshly. implicit bias is a problem for everyone implicit bias is a problem for ever"
also, trump exposed all the problems hillary has created and failed to resolve over the years.
i actually think lester is doing a great job- and both candidates are poking eachother, with little interuption
i agree, but i think she's controlled &amp; progress can be made with her.
how can you vote for someone who never replies and always avoid questions. she made a mistake and tonight again she admitted it.
"this post sponsored by guccifer 2.0"...
but at least the oil isn‚Äôt in chicago because it is worse than a warzone. did we try stop and frisk in iraq?!
gimme hillary pryor over donny manziel easy
my tweets are always tweets of the year nick, but thank you
will hilary release 30000 emails for trump tax release ?
despicable and atrocious
what policy? the dude knows nothing..
girl, i was begging for a commercial break! lol
hey hyd check these beats
that was a annihilation it was like a football team going up against a high school football team
i literally called that she would wear a red suit i'm so happy she did.
fuck y'all my snaps were funny as fuck
fascinating though as romney had only brief bounce after first debate. if it is really change debate then she might slip
yes lmao second time it's happened to me in 5 days
hillary. trump was just white noise
literally not even a second. i've barely seen commercials for the show. but, i think it's time.
oh my gosh same it's the best highlighter on the market
sorry i don't speak canine can you repeat that sparky?
yep, follow the money please.
of course you will say that but it is what it is!
no it is donald trump lies and he is a jack ass and we want hillary clinton to win
everytime he had hilary caged up, she would smile to show her cool and it happened very often tinight.
well done hillary! trump finally found a good makeup artist.
he needs to blame us brown people cus we are voting!
i guess bald heads are a blank canvas. ;)
oh the grammar is just delicious
no he didn't
fuck off kkkunt.
that is all we want to know. lol.
not going to the prom. just really good with someone who has a clue and not crazy. someone really competent.
some, yes, but there were too many times when holt didn't stop him when he was going on too long
a women who pressed a button and deleted 30,000 emails should not be trusted with nuclear codes!
in no way did she kick his butt. she lied and blinked the entire night
and i have been to falls.
let's start a hashtag.
thanks, we need it!
yes talk about it.
agreed. *looked* and *behaved* like a leader. simple as that.
if there was one big bomb i think it may be the stamina comment.
lies, liar, pathetic!
it's infested with idiots, there's only one solution, nuke it from orbit,
this reminds me- can you leave a review for my app? üòú
hillary's calm demeanour was a good strategy and worked to her advantage as trump lost his cool and came out swinging, as always.
actually, she looked smug and indifferent rather than concerned about the people. your hrc blindness isn't helping her improve.
what is that though!!??
i agree he could've pushed on the emails issue, but then she ended it by admitting the full fault
very good podcast.
i learned about it on beam weeks ago it'[s aight it's aight....
went to a book launch
no! thank you for sharing üòâüòä
is weirdly deferential to her. is she the one woman roger ailes didn't try to fuck?
less buck shot and more duck/turkey. more .22lr. but that's a good thing. less 5.56 and more .223
or just fire him for the 26th time
i should have had this tonight while watching the debate lol would have helped me
i'd like to think that hrc won't do a complete reversal on the progressive policies adapted by the democratic platform.
the way the debate was run put trump on defense all night , i think common people understand him, he's not been in politics 30 y
but actually s/o to the hardworking editors and camera people trying to keep those letters lined up in the face of unbearable stupidity
oddly enough, someone i work with mentioned this to me today so it's a sign i now must go.
are you mad too or any other corporation that does the same? say a record company, a shoe company or a sports team?
true but it still makes my head hurt.
minutiae point. everyone got the point, except you 2
she directly addressed them. your response confused me.
what's most depressing is there are 46% of americans who find this bs inspiring :(
um... over prepared? how so that equatable with under prepped in a pres debate?
yes you write words you know nothing about anything
donald won.
yep. as long as he keeps repeating the same sound bites, he's safe.
as you should. the hell is wrong with people !
she was pumped with ?
i stay off of fb.i don't want to discuss politics with friends. ltrump is mean, cheating elitist.i lived in dads trump village
no. he admitted that he pays no federal income tax because ‚Äúi‚Äôm smart.‚Äù
at least youre not a little hoe ): üòÇ
ha! i read this and thought the same thing.
if everybody does free trade, it's the best. but nobody can cheat!!!
in 10 years, if you don't post ur selfie you will be suspect. violates ur privacy. ?
trump: (intimates assassination) clinton ads: (quotes trump verbatim) trump: you're not nice! waaah! she's being mean to me!
lol my shock is incalculable!
true, but i do miss russert. every time.
exactly!!! lol he looks like he would sing that
should have a comment on this
i respect your commitment to the
you will anyway! i laughed, i cried, i said the word fascist louder than ever before, i booed &amp; maybe hisses once. all good
and the men you want to say yes and no to
ahem, i believe mexico is going to pay for all them from now on. try to keep up erich.
wish you were closer. he's a beauty
oh wait that's cause i muted them all lol bye
you're absolutely crazy. he won't even do the next 2 debates. he got crushed.
they probably broke that ceiling in brooklyn all for
we do our crumby best. üòÄüòÄüòÄ
i couldn't even get in, they gave tickets to only 100 kids out of the whole school üòÇ
there is definitely crying in baseball. this game is so special.
because he can't tell the difference.
lol, that's all she got, 30 years in government and nothing to show for it. women should remember that instead
of course she does, i almost feel sorry for bill.
yes, in a tweet that was just deleted.
why consider nuclear war an option? zero idea. it's called "mutually assured destruction" for a reason.
or she gets how many millions from radical islamic countries
u could dead suck a dick and die. like hope he haunts u at night
really hates an audience.
prepare for the greatest thing in the world
ima mak that a video how many views do you think that would get? lol
i told her that. got a problem with that???
that's dangerous
ew let's not talk about your asshole god knows where that's been!
he sleeps in a coffin and gains his strength by stripping the rights of lgbt citizens... he'll be fine.
i actually have a headache from itüòÇüòÇ
convention of states, it is our only hope.
if only moderated this debate.
we're screwed as the usa with either of them why can't people love one another no matter race, gender, or religion
omg you must want to just go home and crawl under your bed and hide. what a disaster for you. how humiliating. omg
not necessarily true. i have no more confidence in the than i do
you really bought that tax return shit?
or maybe i've had panda express four nights in a row and the world needs to be turning around me bc man damn
this is why dems are struggling. a perception gap.
i think anyone with half a brain, knows the only "crooked" person is the one with 500 lawsuits against him. grow a brain
dropped a word in the second graf. believe its "lost"
won only on
well, only if there's no !
very much this. i was more frustrated after than during. jesus. i'm gonna get some ice cream ok good night
just called your san jose store and the manager wants me to bring back a 90 lb and 7ft long box to exchange.
uhh, assuming military/industry counts as making a term acceptable...
3rd party candidate?
bowing my head in ...... and hoping he gets well soon
tell me about it! same here
i think steven hawkins is smart but he's also oblivious to god and the power in which he can't explain üíØ
its much more likely were voting for pence at this point‚Ä¶ i dont think he actually understand the gravity of where he is (trump)
thanks senator - i lost my copy of 's talking points.
where is the graph about who farted the most!!!
televised debates turned the tide for jfk, but i suppose one could say it's diff circumstances now
to talk finally about his influential role in shutting down the gw bridge?
i already can tell you're too stupid to if you think trump is even a remotely good choice
she was also wearing red and he had a blue tie (role reversal for the day)
"so, shots?" "shots."
false equivalence
i have resolved that i chose her bc the alternative is too scary
new favorite word
exactly, then change your status, k.
maybe he didn't....but he would have....
i wouldn't know how to. but you sound like a man who knows how to do it. done it often? giving lessons?
her answer to that one, tho... üé§
if you are talking about the ny airports he is 100% correct.
i kind of want the president of the most powerful nation in the world to be overprepared. i was a boy scout.
lmaoooo it's a fact tho...did u peep those cheekbones?
hiding his 'lack of stamina?' maybe he's coming down with pneumonia! üòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑ
clinton did good..... but she is so dirty.... no mention of the clinton foundation either
it is a real tragicomedy üò±üòÇ
what did y'all think?
california!
omg this made me so mad!
right, the people showing up in your feed.
would you say that hillary won "bigly"?
in my 14 person league i was referring to, my own team screwed me, who knew.
and it will be again if donald gets the job.
i hope not. i hope the undecided heard her clearly. that's what counts. i'm watching and few trump supporters are swayed.
correction. trump sniffed
my synopsis of the debate
says the moron w 4 followers lol
performed tonight like she knew people were looking to create debate memes üòÇüòÇüòÇ
. as the son of a dental hygienist, and the ex-boyfriend of a dentist, her dental work is horrible.
lmfaoo my dad was so tight he returned both of our hats the next day üòÇ
yep. not nice!
please stay out of politics.
not even a q!
surprising tbh
he's also *very* proud of a lot of things.
what fun is that?
she legit said to him that trump's appeal to black people was good. like, you're telling him?
thanks mom!
go watch my last tweet. i think you'll enjoy it. its to all the people who slander refugees.
no kidding! the mute button is my friend.
considers modern maritime law a european biased construct and therefore revisionist in itself.
school deaths videos
exhilarating indeed!
hey did i subtweet correctly? cuz that was about u ‚ù§Ô∏è
was waiting for this comment
or there should be a hg wells style "dictatorship of the air". either/or.
the debate was closer to pro wrestling at its best than raw was
agree but predictable. the entire campaign has lacked solid details and any level of conversation with substance.
yeah, the pr pros working for these brands are doing a good job. was great, as well
he actually choked at one point--
in the post debate spin, he did.
if you believe that, i have a bridge for sale.
we met at the dnc among the smell of your supporter's marijuana and petrulli... are you still on the ballot?
i think that trump pissed him off by refusing to answer the questions, like how you bring jobs back.
can you please let her go xd?
i didn't sunday it's ray donavan and the strain plus football
you could have stopped trump, but you had to have your warmonger. you blew it, kid.
oh no.. this is elementary school all over again for him ü§ï
oh yeah?! well youre a great human being and that's final!
tomorrow :)
no i am listening to my conscience because i believe women, minorities, gays and non christians are part of america too
but the point is that she is wrong. trump has been saying so for months. give him credit for leading onit
are you gonna call me like you said you would?! is this even your real phone number?!
i had tickets to see him at 54 below but then i completely forgot about the concert and missed it üò£
if deletes the tweet you can reference this screenshot.
you a real one and if someone doesn't see that then that's their fucking loss.
i'd take a robot instead a racist dumb asshole anytime üëç
thank you for proving the fact that people not getting educated&amp;involved is the problem.
..10 generations, in my part of the globe.
over prepared for the most powerful job in the world?? delete your fucking account.
am just battling to stay hydrated and conscious. could this night be worse?
hi, i heard y'all wanted to see a rat trying to retrieve a toy from a pool of water instead of stressful shit ‚ù§Ô∏è
lol , forgets that he's running for president. he needs to strap on his dick if he wants to be prez
i want to cuddle up next to u in a corner
im an african american &amp; i don't live in hell but if trump were to win we all will be living in a place hotter
my understanding of event sequence: they hidden it first, and then opened it back up after backlash.
we must hope so.
will rebroadcast it &amp; post it online very quickly
poor lester though, oh gosh. felt so bad.
really close now
the one thing i wanted to hear was what would they do about stopping terrorists here in u.s neither really answered the q! ü§î
hahaha you should have been in the group text with &amp; i. we'll add you next time.
that said, hillary seems like the kind of candidate that would have the right people in place to address such issues.
they know what it is. nobody wants to pay any damages again.
i absolutely loathe the lesser argument but one will have office unfortunately. one of them (imo) would clearly do more harm
now i really believe trump will win
we're done with you homie
but spend less time thinking about nato and bad that the 400 pound person sitting on his bed is churning out
ok well in comparison trump interrupted clinton 27 times while she interrupted him 15.
i'm in bed sick &amp; thought i saw same thing. "doc? i need the really strong painkillers"
what do you mean 'overcharge'?
stop spreading this. he called his fam up and immediately shook lesters hand.
your mom doesn't have the stamina. sorry. within
i think your definition of suffering is wrong. you say everyone but i'm fine. so are you. so i'm confused ?
i was supposed to learn something from that?
that might make it interesting. television and politics can't be interesting! or can it?
if only you could see the side eye i just gave
making stuff up like this is literally the reason donald is leading. just use the real ammo
. - a true poll may b 0%. have u noticed blk ppl @ his rally seem like props, maybe paid 2 b there!
someone should remind him that hillary is running not bill.. 3 wives?
i've used the .22 and it seemed fine. just was told .223 is problematic.
lester is a lousy &amp; bias moderator.who cares about obama's birth controversy? lester purposely interrupts trump.
the question really is how much actual substance was said in those words
fuck trump. the president of the usa?
he never said that tho
you'd still catch the gap tho
my fault lmao but the baby in the pic still her own
i need to send you a tub of ice cream! to cool you down.
we are just fucked no matter what, everyone's entitled to their opinion
ü§óüòòonly, the one who really, really physically gets you

oh please so lame he never voted for any war your gal is the warmonger
the charles barkley part? lester could have been better, but hard to corral trump's childlike yelling
disgusting! rapist and pedophile!
i convinced myself she cared lol üòÇ marty's like bitch please... um no..
yeah that's why i tweeted that to let people know
oh thanks man
this such a good question
you on it tonight
was not good 2 see so many personal attacks, coming from both sides. we get it we literally get it
it's sounds so reasonable to be something sir charles would say, lol
he's probably wondering how many words she can type per minute.
he went back &amp; shook his hand probably because was frantically telling him to.
"you've gotta be kidding me! this is fucking bullshit! i have to walk literally 3 miles" üëâüèø
my god, trump said clinton has been fighting isis most of her adult life??? wtf..?
what math? the clinton body count? that's really big numbers; gonna get a calculator, brb...
always won my fantasy games so üôå
that's because your dad lost. lol!
because it's a lost cause- go home donald trump. you're in way over your square and orange head
this may be the only time i'll agree with donald trump.
the show didn't need to have extra low latency, but what it did demand was multiple bitrates of hd/sd video to serve on demand.
she's a true moron, the only people who won't think he lost are losers like them who think he can't do any wrong
we're just exchanging equal amounts of snark that cancels each other out so it only looks like we're nice to each other.

i just checked our thermostat its 84 in here tonight it was 83 last night

is this a joke?? the murder rate has climbed in nyc since 2013??? really??
we all know the media is bought and paid for by elite globalists. hillary definitely their choice puppet
what a joke.

was decent, easy to say this cause hill's_billy looks like death warmed over
also disheartening that the bar is set so low that not yelling racist things &amp; being kind of civil is considered him doing well
bitcoin, or stash your pile with a credit union, and just use yer big bank for transactions, etc. but not chase.
remember that bk crispy chicken commercial she did?
yup she would say thatüòÇüòÇ
orange marshmallow.
agreed, the lack of sentiment analysis is troubling. hey guys, engage us!! i can help!
if i didn't have a nice little combo of tonsillitis and strep i'd be there but it's gunna have to wait //:
well if hillary wins, we're fucked.
that was a good statement
that is my hot take goodnight
i have a lot of very anti-hilary republicans in my fb feed, my waco and texas relatives. total silence tonight.
overprepared? i'll take that every time.
haha honestly i didn't look close enough to know!
3p's! presidential, poised,polished - clinton by a landslide
yep. caste &amp; bias allowed mediocrity to flourish. talented poc &amp; women were cast aside.
nope. just interpreting it as both camps partisans are. voters aren't dumb. they can draw their own conclusions.
well think about it..if this is true, he's not in jail for tax evasion &amp; he's a candidate for president. kinda smart
ohhh nahh this is the greatest video ever top 5 top 5 top 5 üò≠üòÇüòÇ
newsflash, trump supporters don't care about facts. clinton should have thrown more punches. she let him off the hook
oh don't worry his economic plan will make sure the wealthy pay less taxes because they don't want pay taxes.
i laugh every time i click on it!
it hit my electric scooter and lifted it up off the ground a little and it hit my arm, but i'm ok, i banged on the hood &amp; 1/2
i find the prospect of a trump presidency frightening for our constitution and for our planet.
its been high 90s the past few daysüò©
this is why white people are scared. lol
no more lester.
trump did enough, especially while questions were about policy to win big. too bad he went with cheap shots,probably told to..
that would be one hell of an expensive biscuit if i were the competitive type ü§ì
i think the soonest that would be is the nlcs, if they make it.
i prefer a baseball analogy (indians win divisions!) , but i respect your expertise as always.

me when i see your tweets. you're a rapist! no surprise you support trump who is a misogynist
: trump clearly won.
trump is not a career politician like secretary clinton a dynasty of lies, and corruption.
guess she'll have to school you on those topics in debates 2 and 3, if you show up.
omg i thought i heard that too (lol, eyes right to the subtitles)
he really thought üòÇ
yes would like to see him without and then he can grow it back or not update the look
to be fair, i don't believe trump audibly passed gas. or was that not the intro presser?
cool, thanks for suggestions and checking in! btw. you should record your book for :)
he certainly must be familiar with the dope part of that strategy.
it's the thought that countsüíó
is that a jaws shirt with a cat on it?
word. your comment is confusing hofer...
that is pretty fucking drunk. 2016
i never said there are more repubs than dems on fb; just proportionally more than twitter.
he doesn't have a formal title.
have you tried `overcast` ?
both very disappoint to not be discussed. is this a reflection of attitudes?
i love that cleanse.
money make the world go money make the world go money make them panties go money make them panties go
*shots fired*
he's not "leightweight," but he definitely "chocked"
clinton has more balls and brains that trump. you go girl!!
he sniffled so much up there bec he's allergic to the truth
you think he will show up to the next debate?
no=nonsense,just like obama birth issue. her 100%failed record &amp; marxist delusions give 100 other issues 2 use
he probably washes it out quickly also hard water will do it too.
q. how can you fit trump in a shoe box? a. give him an enema.
yes and fantasy, fable &amp; fiction are applicable to the other "realms"--don't be so dishonest.
same it's been too long since we were all togetherüò≠üíïüëèüèª
perjury, obstruction of justice, and public corruption, look 'em up!

candidates should have to pass a competency test before they can run!
i just had to let you know ü§ì
the moderator is liberal biased. he only questioning trump . he is a disgrace why do they pick idiots.
said he did like how govt spent it. i think trump still available himself of our polic,fire dept waste removal and roads
i mean actually working towards something? pshaw. that's a tremendous mistake.
not what i meant but still right.
i love u &amp; completely agree
ha! i'm sure everyone can't wait for me to shut up about it. forgive me!
except for people who thought trump was unprepared, rude and incoherent. this will b reflected in the polls in the coming days.
i don't deserve this special treatment wyd lys
i mean i typically always take more than you're supposed to too but i'm just gonna be really disappointed when i wake up feeling
there are plenty of legitimate reasons to attack trump. preserve your credibility
true. capitalism is the root of all evil.
cnn insta poll gives hillary a 62-27 win in tonight's debates, and we're all gonna remember this epic fact check
majority watching cnn are for clinton, so poll a joke! fox poll shows trump won debate!
criminals clintons!
plus americone dream is already a thing.
not nearly entertaining nough
i think it's more 90%. he's had 4 bad in what 100 or 200. it's a phenomenal success rate.
the tip off is in autocorrect - it doesn't recognize it yet! and yes.
takes 5 people w/advanced degrees to decipher this nuance? y'all working them brains too hard...
show us those tax returns
he sure didn't do it tonight. he got his clock cleaned by hillary!
people behind the central bank which lends money to the government on interest
they would blame the other people when they didn't even do anything
my friend just started screaming "i hate you" over and over
imagine him putting divergent topics at the bottom of a white board, or saying ‚Äúdeep dive‚Äù.

i implore you to reconsider. he will be a liability in delicate international negotiations &amp; deeply harm safety of minorities.

i'd happily take that l of your hands.

at that time one month!! haha..! üò≥
lol copy üòå you really be treating me like one of ya bozo ass followers ü§îüòÇ shit crazy üòíüíØ
nooo favors! in addition, trump laid off the emails.
they wouldn't have let this idiot in to begin with.
agreed ... but let's retire the "but that would be an insult to ..." cliche as it's beyond tired.
that's a joke, right?
i used the word "girl" on purpose to satirically reflect dt's maturity level.
but if you're me and i'm you are you running a fade on yourself
r u talking to urself?
: arrest this piece of crap for anarchy and facilitation of rioting.
scary but true

lol. what just happened.
they do so they can touch his hand
no your not alone, its mind boggeling how he's lasted this long
well juan if race has to be talked about, haven't you noticed a trend within certain race of people? where they commit too much
that he is now as dependent on a horse race for his job as the rest of the msm...
he couldn't even get a twitter handle without the underscore? what a loser! sad!
try windsor!! üòª
great picture! she was so amazing!
plse did watch debate? trump dealt with moderator interrupting him, clinton didn't.
hillary the best ..
he's a child.
i didn't fact check the spelling.. i just spell words correctly
i wish y'all could have seen what this thread became. it was amazing.
she can't be a president if she doesn't know how american ppl struggle with every day life!!!! she better get her ass out
anyway, this point is handled. increasingly vague rebuttals ignored
6 key moments 1) hillary no stamina2) she lies3)mediasupportsher lies4)30 years of doing nothing good for usa 5 no stamina 6)she lies
it looks insanely close to me.pretty crazy
trump's better off not opening up that issue bc if he does,married 3 times,cheated on wives, would like to "date" his daughter!
just think, at least you'd land a first job &amp; become one of your screw-ball, b1tch-arse, gutter-freak, gluttonous alums.
fuck you and terry...brooklyn, queens, the bronx and manhattan will send ya ass back to 5th ave, muthafucka!
are you serious lester let trump walk all over him, gulliani needs to stop talking
if i don't roast you it means i don't love you
dunno, here you can see the black shift consistent w/ a blue selection for the bricks vs brown for coat

then, i have to commit, literally, myself [!?] to like u would not believe ‚òÜ
may say so but keeps mic(military industary complex) high paying jobs with itself..... war econ0my
with what's going on in the news lately, how important is it to portray a black, bulletproof, super hero?
lester holt did a fantastic job tonight!
my opinion is that u shouldnt decide it on one tweet made by someone who might work for her js
one of the first what?
its very clear she doesn't have the stamina or integrity to run our country
why not watch both?
we voted for hillary in massive numbers. worked out great.
of the focus groups are right, she should spoke up to her pre 9/11 numbers
he is one sorry ass little dick ,, russian plant!! he should just delete everything before they get his 1/2 lb. ass!
how does one over-prepare for the office of the presidency?
right?! wtf does chuck think, muthafucka's get voted off each week for being knowledgeable nerds?
tremendous clip of trump interrupting hillary 28 times during the debates and pouting like a child
fuck you you technologically incompetent mexican
amazing how you lie just like your master. soros
why did this happeb
- very nice photog. i really like the pic - had to say good work kids..
james i think her exposed server caused benghazi.
piece of cake
i agree with you 100%. i am tired of hearing about clinton's "likability" factor.
yeah i hope it'll print fine. or that someone caught it.
all 12votes from phone went to uüéâüéâüéâ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
let me know when were playing h1 boy
lying again in spite of fact debate was televised.
stop. that's not even true
not a fan of her but her restraint was incredible. even when donald kept interrupting.
as a sports fan i am familiar with the loosing team blaming the referees for their losses.
i think on the whole she was definitely less hawkish than usual, but it was by no means devoid of imperialist rhetoric
once in a while, i draw matsu comics and post them on the internet. i have a choro and nyaa-chan scene starting now.
so u complain cus they blocked u back ü§î
but i'll say this: i sat among prominent trump surrogates and donors in the hall tonight. no celebrating and a lot of long faces at the end.
what a shame.
dude, your guy got destroyed by a girl!! i admit there are two more debates, but when he has bobby knight helping him
yep! you're so right, rosie, and it was so weird to hear that in the middle of the debate!
i can't even.... words escape me on this one
thank you grace
i don't know i don't talk to them but ima vandalize their home ü§î
if i may shamelessly self-plug, i did a list of 10 found footage films to check out if you liked bw
for the next debate?
do you really want this election to be about who has better character? i'd stick with the "change" message-both ain't angels
pls u could barely handle the ones they did cover
you're such a hater lol
was it some kind of seizure? why so thirsty? maybe his renal functions failing. or withdrawl from meds.

trump the debate, bring back laws and order, help inert cities rebuild and jobs jobs jobs
say what? i don't think you understand my tweet.
lol keep thinking that, the polls say otherwise
i always thought he was on speed. diet pills from dr. bornstein. he would be the healthiest president.
. yes .. too cheap to pay for the courts he uses so much nor the military that keeps us safe and free
did he break a law? if not, blame the person responsible for the tax code.
rudy is batshit crazy
actually, the reality of our country is that it's growing more &amp; more diverse, which racist trump hates.
i wish she would be useful and plant some trees.
look i'm not saying does cocaine. i know people, great people who tell me things. i'm not saying it.
i'm on it. now what?
most ppl can't find america in a map of north america
a million excuses not to release his tax returns because he knows there are illegal info in them plus ties to russia &amp; china.
was her normal mean nasty entitled lying self.dt spoke truth 2power
check my follow up.
and she held back on your own "indiscretions" because of all the kids those indiscretions produced?
wouldn't dr bornstein have discovered this during his extensive examinations?
and whrn she mentioned that dt said 'shd blow them out of water' dt shd have brought-up iran naval incident
what i do is i chew alot of gum and try to sit in a middle seat . that helps it a little for me
omg was today your first day?!?!

young readers are flooding our news room with support for 11-year-old christopher! 1,000s‚Ä¶
is that the best he can do bring it he is such an idiot how about bringing some substance to the debate
i also managed to come in first place in 2/5 matches despite it being hot as balls! üòÅüëçüèº
they need to also do something to make a difference, rather then just hyping it up.
that balance notion. shit is real now. very. i think to undecided voters, the only ones who matter, he did not do well
have a good tuesday u all (:
i enjoyed it tremendously.
those feetsüòç
he should blame it on the bad gear he snorted.
yeah, i sounded like a quite a shithead there. oh, and the lyft ride home took all of 7 minutes. ugh, my life is hard.

this is only the first debate. she was prepared for anything he wasn't. she got under his skin so easily. not fit
well wouldn't your entire adult life be from 18 or 21 years old?
i am betting he'll suddenly come up with a bunch of impossible conditions by tomorrow. not realizing this first one will stick.
trump knows how to ready a performance, a stance, a persona. but he's never had to absorb or present information. no reason to think he can.
lol i know right
and corrupt warmonger hillary who helped kill millions in iraq, syria, libya &amp; honduras is just as fucking scary as trump.
have a good tuesday u all
. he may have lost the election too but we'll let bygones be bygones, right?
you guys continue to live in some fantasy land. clinton clearly won that debate. not even close.
falling all apart. why? it's not fair man. we could have had much better, cosmopolitanism well done. so much went to waste.
i am not sure if this strikes me as a matter of talent. the irs doesn't seem to be as leak-prone as other agencies.
oh no i would never!
i guess you were both doing coke tonight
he performs at finland today
new york city!!!!!
so very sad that you are reporting anything that man says as actual news. i guess you really are part of the problem!
bye elections are always a bye for the sitting government. people wish to get solutions out of governing party.
well whered he go? chipotle? ü§î
linda you hit it right, she is a smug, self serving politician, that was very clear to us, i hope to everyone!
what a dope
what this does is give permission to that 10% of dumb-dumbs going for johnson to break for clinton when they come to their senses
heres hoping the sex is a maze ing
you're doing bad
it handles better than a st with the ford racing suspension and the st wheels
we'll plan it out when we see each other!
um, no it's not. she just killed it as a completely qualified, formidable candidate.
i sobbed involuntarily when he gracefully dropped that one üôà
lowkey i'm curious but it's gunna be scary
well she definitely wouldn't take a lot of that interrupting.
and god knows how many people have been killed by top secrets held on her unsecured server! she should be locked up!

trump missed opportunities he could attack hillary on libya, cyber security, the multiple devices hillary was using.
younger brains, sharper minds

i just heard you say this in real life and i'm dying laughing
will there ever be video?
o really i see yea because i just checked thanks for telling me man appreciate it .
hahah it's amazing how we never agree on anything. why do we even follow each other?!
submit your details here:
many people say he snorts coke very very much, sad!
a statistically valid poll (versus a nonsense internet poll). hillary won the debate by a mile.
and condescendingly referring to secretary clinton as "her"
we heard there are a few smaller fires, one by glenwood cutoff.
you are certifiably off your rocker. you are a discraze
dan! people will actually believe that lol now jill will use that tweet as a support testimonial
hillary also prep'ed for being sec of state but that did no good. i'll take trump's common sense over her prep any time
where at? üëÄ my screen f'd up too üòÇ
it's still going. glad you were fortunate to keep out of the are and safe ‚ù§Ô∏è
come play it's fun here. we have grills
i really should üòÇ

what!?? you! the most interesting account on twitter has nothing!!! i blame the donald. üòí
hillary clinton is a criminal !!!
you gotta just pray &amp; go to sleep
omg thank you
i guess her real body was just like‚Ä¶brought back to earth by the wish?
learn something new everyday
beautiful portrait!
trump has 1000's of photos with black people spanish etc. hilliary has one with obama . it is old!
which is your fav.?
ohhhhhhh otay lol
2/ here are some good instructions on how to take bug reports on the device without "adb".
laughable poll only one that said she won.. dam you guys are funny
think the donald is s8ck? pneumonia maybe? sniff, sniff. üòâüòâüòâüòâ
out of respect 4 chelsea, he didn't. he showcased incompetent h but not
it looked rehearsed between lester and hillary. i would not put it past nbc to rig it in her favor!
she also learned a lot of his weak points. suggesting he's not as wealthy as he claims is a huge one
great piece on and his social/political activism for the palestinian and muslim community‚ù§Ô∏è check him out! he's dope!
everything she does is a code to something/someone.
. then again, the one who's less knowledgeable, less professional, and less honest is a white male, so... --too many folks
thanks, and thanks for watching!
yes they were. course afterwards they ran her off before she could b asked questions by press that lester didn't ask. hide hillary
yeah and the rest of us deplorables will be tuning in
i have my taxes done every year and i'm retired, when i look at the final product, i know why i have them done! who cares!
this is a pic from the other side of my mountain.... scary...
boulderfist and crashing storm. rockbiter alone hits like a wet noodle, but with boulderfist, it's badass
you were a fucking disgrace tonight. your not fair your bias towards hilliary and she still lost! your a pos human!
excellent idea!!!!
you're literally doing the same thing rn
definetely! check me out! you can find me on itunes and youtube.
it even prevents the troops for staying too long without review and declaration of war
going to school and majoring in shit that should be self taught only leads to repetitive, dull and uncreative artists.
not like this, he has to be sick and on meds. dry mouth too.
in this and only this
um, no, dumbass, read variety's last article. you lost handily.
it‚Äôs funny because he talks like that but also literally in my twitter feed lots of people were actually saying trump was on a ton of coke.
can't disagree if hilary is a thief or not but you can't sit there and say trump isn't lucky
samuel that's very thoughtful of you my king. thank you! :))
shut up foo üôÑ
yes! now playing 'the magnificent seven' free2watch just press-n-play,.
tomorrow night we're watching the last two episodes and i'm just breath-taken by how good it is.

aw. i think i saw a couple of clips of hyunjin from that show. where are you watching it from?
life. and i do not trust hillary with my life. this world will turn into a 3rd

correct, and in good taste, and they have every reason to state it, that i shouldn't get mad.
it was a joke lmaooooo and i'm kinda doing alright, but thanks
nice sweater

i hope i wasn't being too indirect -- different treatment of suspects depending on what race they belong to is wrong.

: hilarity clinton has absolutely no substance. the only thing she did was personally attack trump.
lol yes üòÇ i just fckn hate going bruh, waste of time

this is getting to be like big love
it's a thing i'm currently building for another project and different sensors. let's chat!
trump is first gop candidate to be so brazenly anti-business. its crazy. and is a fucking man child.
opinions should not produce an outright poorly written article that misses facts and is framed w/ bias
will technical class engage in politics or change politics to their frame?
maybe they should hold the election in an ecclesiastical setting... to focus the mind.
people do. (maybe not lawyers‚Ä¶) but no record = no tax write off as charity.
