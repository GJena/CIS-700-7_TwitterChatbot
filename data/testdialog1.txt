i just did a double-take :)...(and you're right)
let me out of this bubble! dear god, please let me out of this "big ugly bubble." debates2016
can you win a debate by yelling? i'm just asking...
does hillary really think trump is running to financially benefit himself? what a crazy statement!
trump it's not time to brag about money you idiot
twitch should stream this debate can you imagine twitch chat during this shit show?
you know, i understand that hillary is less bad over donald trump but....god how did you guys end up with such unlikable candidates
why is so dehydrated?
. came out strong .
you can't sit this election out. add your name right now to say you’re with hillary!
what did she lie about?
i love when she speaks, i really do.
hillary's eyes are going off-center. he's getting to her hard.
holt: trump, who do you owe money to?
trump clearly hates america. he thinks we are a horrible miserable shitty country of losers. why would anyone vote for a hater?
more than once
people are seeing a bully with out a plan. he's been yelling since word 4
but he did make a slapper
here comes the shot at how much he owns and gives
i don't want a president that makes 600 million dollars.
why do people have to be immature and key someone's car..
you get audited because you’re a fucking crook
remember when donald just denied saying this 10 minutes ago?
yes !!!! when they go to spring break lmao
lester: this is secretary clinton's t- trump: i know that. i'm listening. i'm just also talking. it's in the constitution, lester.
very clear in the first 2 minutes that donald trump is not prepared.
everyone tonight on snapchat
if they let gary johnson debate i'm sure he could swing enough voters to make it interesting. clinton and trump belong in the ball pit.
the donald is dominating this debate!!! 🇺🇸
very wise decision if they'd like to live to see tomorrow 😊
trump just said he is smart for not paying taxes, right?
love how on debate day everyone on twitter thinks they know politics, and none of they are actually informed whatsoever😂
half of hillary's brain is accessing facts &amp; info to use for the debate the other half is in utter disbelief she's competing with this moron
really? that's news to me and. pretty much goes hand in hand with capitalism
just wait till tomorrow
we can discuss the debate but this conversation is going nowhere lol
is this really the best you can do america?
hillary just fact-checked trump using 's story on trump's $650 million in debt
in real-time
a significant silver lining of the trump candidacy could be the resurgence of the term "jackanape."
alright that was just messed up..
right? as crooked as they both are...she obviously has more sense....he cant answer a question straight😫😫
well one of these things was just proven with a tweet, but keep on feeling that bern dude
he thinks that's what makes him popular with everyone and it does with the crazies for sure.
. reads on not releasing his tax returns &amp; accuses him of owing the irs . he was silent on that one . ha !
dead ass though lol
trump just accused hillary of being a politician who is all talk and no action. bitch you don't even have a plan.
there's no way donald trump knows what braggadocious means
wtf is donald trump talking about with these airports
clinton: maybe trump won't release tax returns because he doesn't want people to know "he's paid nothing."
i’m wary that i’m seeing what i want to see, but i think she’s gotten under his skin.
"it's not a lot of money." ???!!!!!!
this is as painful as i expected
wooooooooow we don't get store brands that cheap here, but may do in the cities, i really don't know! gr8 value.
how did trump even start talking about airports being upgraded?
did trump just agree he never pays federal income taxes?
i do agree there, our airports do suck compared to dubai and london. lol
i just published “promotion and growth in canaan’s tech practice”
this is 🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌
literally the only true thing donald trump has said this election cycle is that laguardia and lax are shitholes.
iwannawatchthedebate!!!!! dammit. too late and far too busy. good luck america.x
melanie plagiarizes michelle, donald plagiarizes joe.
that makes me smart will go down as an incredibly stupid debate moment.
he's a child.
i do prefer jfk over that shit storm but ... 3rd world? 🤔
muchas gracias yesy! thank you for being part of it 😘😘😘😘💛💛💛
live fact-check: clinton wrongly describes how much trump has paid in taxes based on past releases. via
airports are joe biden's thing, you back off.
trump complaining about how lax makes us a 3rd world country compared to dubai is sure gonna bring in that economically dislocated vote
he also said he didn't pay taxes cause he's smart. but i'd like to think i'm smart too so 🤔
clinton practiced keeping it concise on emails: "you know, i made a mistake...i am not going to make any excuses and i take responsibility."
"6 trillion in the middle east, we could have rebuilt our country twice." the press was looking for zingers. there it is.
...and then i quit recommending your app to educators anywhere.
why you suh cute?
clinton: i'm met a lot of people who have been stiffed by you &amp; your business, people you refused to pay when they finished for you.
if you're watching this in your blue bubble u probably have no idea how this is playing in the living rooms &amp; kitchenettes of middle america
did he just say he's smart for not paying federal taxes 🤔 pretty sure this man just admitted to breaking the law
i've flown quite a bit. i think the airports with tech charging stations and ipads to order food at the gate aren't exactly 3rd world...
❤️ hillary!!!
. claims we wouldn't learn much from his tax returns. so why has he yet to release them, hmm?
good thing that kids dad didn't give him 10's of millions of dollars. oh wait.
so,for everyone not watching the us presidential debate tonight: why are you not watching? curious as to the reasons for it.
hillary, for fuck's sake, he just said the country's fucked because of the iraq war - a republican endeavor! bush's war, not yours!
i thought o'hare was bad until i went to laguardia. an actual shithole
yes indeed. whenever that match happens, of course.
notice how trump hasn't denied any of hillary's allegations regarding his taxes
thanks bro, miss you !❤️
said paying taxes would get the usa out of debt?? fund all the infrastructure improvements? what a ridiculous statement..
it is shocking that the republican party is ok with what is happening right now.
they got internet here. barely.
this is so hard to watch.
it was strange as hell and it seemed to come out of nowhere. my memaw still sends me home with watchtower magazines
yeeeeah... needs to address his abuse of his unfulfilled business obligations
i can't even rationalize this nonsense to my cat, who's clearly horrified
was literally at newark last week. their airport rail shuttle is bomb af
seriously, if you're a supporter, how the hell is this landing for you?
did trump make fun of someone for playing golf?! did he forget he owns golf courses?!
that cruiser match was great.
the more she argues that she’s an expert/knows policy, the more she reinforces his core critique: that she is part of a status quo.
"i wrote a book about it. you can pick it up tomorrow." -
my own father's architectural firm has been screwed over by trump quite a few times. she could be talking about him
routine audit is not something to brag about
just started "crime and criminals" and i find it so interesting how people can have such polar opposite view points about crime.
i swear this entire campaign is one big ad for that new hotel in d.c.
"i was unsatisfied with his work." jfc patriarchal capitalism at its best. "he worked, i was like eh, naaaah."
that is an awful airport to be fair
forty minutes in, and this is the first real win for her. challenging his bs business record.
i just wanna say that newark airport is p good, ok thank you
has trump even been to a third world country...?
did she just say she's met painters???? lemme find out
i literally don't understand what is happening.
"p-please vote for hilary! acknowledge your privilege an-and vote for hilary!!"
paying zero in taxes doesn’t make you "smart." it makes you a tax evader.
"maybe he didn't do a good job." —donald trump looks like you “loved” it at the time. …
two: the capitalist fantasy to do precisely what he just said, to be the smart guy who slips through the system's demands of reciprocity.
she will start coughing soon
"under budget. ahead of schedule. i'm a year ahead of schedule and that's what this country should be doing". is launching
if you can, watch tonight's debate on your affiliate. don't wanna give ratings to the cable &amp; broadcast networks who've enabled trump.
summer hits of 2000s is better 💁🏼
"trumped up trickled down economics" will that be the sound bite that everyone remembers?
"wrong." "it's all words. it's all sound bites." -
"let's start by talking about race." the country rn:
"this janet yellen of the fed. the fed is doing political." (crowd is moaning)
hey , do any of you think trump is remotely winning this!?!
judging by his performance tonight, i'd say trump's getting to pennsylvania ave via the old post office.
his condescending interjections and interruptions and mansplaining are hitting the deepest part of my womanly frustration
the sniffing! i thought it was hrc who had pneumonia.
hilary: "because you didn't pay any tax." trump: "it would be squandered too." did he just admit to not paying any tax?
"i never said that." —donald trump, who said that.
i'm not saying he should be, but i'm saying you and i would rather pay less taxes if we could, right?
hillary screaming for fact-checkers to bail her out was the worst moment so far. weak.
america "needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals and we don't have the money" —
50 retweets and i'll drop the new sunset 👀this is so fire 🔥thank you for finally listening to the park community
hrc: "you stiffed thousands of workers. you never paid them" djt: "yup. trump hotel opening soon! come check it out!"
see how she uses her charm and charisma to get free access to paywalled science? can you believe it hasn't worked y…
oh race. this will be great.
so what's the score everyone?
oh boy now his main problem is how dated are us airports? is he fucking kidding us? who gives an eff about this?
they are-who made those immoral laws!!
started a new book friday, american gods, and it already seems awesome! mythology books have always been some of my favourites.
why does she go first .... is that on every question?
trump's website is down. should've used clinton's server.
the building we saw in dc!
is making solid points, but will be criticized tmrw for her staccato cadence
hillary clinton does not have the stamina but youve been sucking on water since the 15 minute mark donald trump talk to me
its a tweet. not classified national information
my bofa charges a $5 fee plus 3% so about $20 for using atm in japan :0
trump: "it's all words."
my brain had a panic attack when it tried to picture trump giving the state of the union. just no.
most ppl in creative industries dont fuck with donald trump y or n?
when you get spam comments on your instagram, do you a. ignore them, b. delete them, or c. report them?
trump="it's smart of me not to pay any taxes" "our infrastructure is crumbling." well.
who the fuck cares where you have your investments? that's not solving any problems.
trump is killing it! has created not a single job in her life but has theories.
i can't d&amp;d tweet about this portion.
i'd actually pay you, brandon, to take him
i was in the shower lol
will do. carrara or limestone? johnnie is great. does good work.
"will you be my princess at hoco?" 💗👑
donald is rattled. hillary is smiling aplenty. why isn't donald smiling?
okay can you not say that about our communities, though. it's not cool. "you walk down the street you get shot" shut up.
i'm almost a cpa and this is what they teach you. clients want to beat the tax laws. it's not just donald, it's any rich person
and with cody rhodes getting ready to debut with them, their shows are only going to get better..
great shoutout from on law and order!
but what did you order?
i am shocked to hear is doing a shit job "moderating" the debate.
"we have to bring back law and order." one area where i agree w trump. really miss that tv program
the kids who were stopped and frisked were bad people? hundreds of thousands of them? my neighbors?
brushed up on his ap gov flash cards to learn some lingo in advance of
clinton understands systemic racism is nuanced &amp; needs to be tackled on every level. trump wants to paint himself as a white (orange) savior
the tax to email pivot killed her.
and, it's certainly the "times" her server was hacked.
trump: "i was told by applecare!!!"
they both suck
that must've been the best second of his life lol
here’s donald trump, drinking water during the debate
am i the only one who thinks looks very fatigued? i feel like shes going to collapse
orangelizard
in case you're wondering ... yes racism is deplorable. (see videos of trump rallies if you're wondering what i'm talking about)
this is the definition of stop and frisk, found unconstitutional.
🤔 i'll allow it
nah mate, i need to reset my whole life...
trump wants to take ur guns away boys
i fear that trump supporters are eating this up, even though he sounds like an angry, unhinged, blowhard.
trump loves debt for his businesses! where are his taxes?
i am in tears. you have derailed my plans. my blood is on your hands.
i will stand with police and protect all americans!
note clinton's lack of rebuttal on the constitutionality of stop &amp; frisk.
and said a "very against police judge" who put an end to stop &amp; frisk. what? it's both incorrect and bad grammar
and to think people look up to him as if he's a business god. shameless is too nice a word
i think he's talking about that movie with leonardo dicaprio
they were told to stay silent! wtf?!
lmao i was dead ass thinking about him while trump was saying that it wasn't racial profiling
it's the first time i've seen that much affection towards someone i'm close with i'm shook too
there's only one candidate on stage who will support working families.
the moderator needs to step in. she is controlling the tone of this debate.
. discussing the state of race relations in the u.s.: more cops.
"a judge who was a very against police judge."
quite pissed, not too arsed by an apostrophe r kid
birthday boy spittin true facts
vs actual airport in venezuela. lax is a third world airport? entitled ass... …
i think my feed is broken. this man can not be saying these words. he can not be saying these words!
no word on the black men being murdered in cold blood. claims 'stop and frisk' was good. clap for yourself, donald.
ayyyy no one has mentioned asian americans in this
"law and order" this reminds me so mussolini. what a fascist!
if we bump in to each other on a crowded street it's not us no more it's just you and me
someone messaged me (essentially) "fuck you, you are a failure, you suck" loool
"a very-against-police judge..." eloquence, i don't know why i was so worried
well, there it is. the first time we've called america a third world country. it's disgusting that people are going to vote for this man.
clinton: "everyone should be respected by the law... right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods."
no sir, this was not just one sentence. jp visited and wrote about kasmir many times, reiterated the same opinion.…
"who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency?"
this chick said she goes to raves and is a diehard edm person but she has no idea who the chainsmokers, flume, porter, slushii &amp; more are
i actually feel sorry for her, **** doesn't want to marry or date anyone 😔
he actually started out coherent for like 30 seconds
"we need to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them." - hillary clinton
there are so many employers who take advantage of immigrant workers. i'm seeing one right now on tv.
you... are in a different city than i am.
what's with trump's chronic sniffing? i knew he'd lose it &amp; lie but the sniffing?! is he sick! omg 😱
- a delusional libtard lol ....
oh yay that nra endorsement really carries a lot of weight, good job bucko.
either way this country is fucked, we'll sink deeper into debt and the rich will become richer so people will become communist
do they have notes? or is hillary just straight up memorizing the hell out of important stats?
i agree with donald trump. laguardia is, in fact, a shithole.
this debate needs a laugh track. and maybe seinfeld noises.
where can i watch the debate (in sydney)
i'm not joking. how can any educated person vote for this guy?
excited to go on a sunny beach vacation.... in iceland?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
i have never before needed a drink quite this much.
i feel like i'm watching a weird dance in a carnival mirror maze of racism
thing i owned, ruined by a bodily fluid, a new mom chronicle in 72 installments. today: purse.
trump only wants stop and frisk so he has an excuse for feeling up ivanka
if you're gonna tweet about the damned debate, please leave a cat tax or a boob tax.
please don't let trump win because votes go to u when u know u cannot win...it is way too close...i hope u r negotiating
i'm seeing him on october 23, 24 &amp; 27 overseas ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
his condescending interjections and interruptions and mansplaining are hitting the deepest part of my womanly frustration
//enjoy the picture of coffe
trump's condescension is going to backfire…
i made the mistake of not smokin before this debate...jeez these are our options?
this is the most pointless tweet i've ever sent, but boy, lester's really holding it down. 🙄
power outage at the worst time. saved by the web stream.
who gave this delinquent a blue tick
who's winning the debate?
no i moved to the states 2 months ago lol
well it's in manchester, birmingham &amp; glasgow, once in each city 🙏🏻
and i’m on record as thinking that trump is ludicrously unprepared on policy.
ok but honestly under democratic presidents minorities have not been fairly treated so
think about how impossible of a situation she's in right now. has to appear strong, but can't fly too in the face of ppls' gender hang ups.
wtf is he talking about?
and she is worse....
well i'm glad you're here! sorry you're seeing the worst of our culture so early on.
sure, much much better if you profit from war. is your troll bot programming f'd up?
i hate them both. but trump is like "put the police against black communities. stop &amp; frisk"
special times for freezer friday and saturday nights are those special freezer days
i wondered the same thing. "...partly because it was ineffective." what?
you are like a broken record with this "mre" obsession.
??? i never remember the initial question asked after trump goes on and on with no direction or basic elementary vocabulary
by making new laws that only harm law abiding citizens....
miss donovan, my 6th grade teacher, is rolling in her grave trying to diagram that last sentence (diatribe) from djt
on the contrary, the crime rate changed little when new york city significantly slowed its stop-and-frisk program.
that was awwweesoomeee "yes, i did prepare. i've also prepared to be president" boom
wait he hasn't mentioned the wall yet wtf
he said it would be huge...
this election is a joke . i dislike both of those fucking racist liars
claiming credit for the birth certificate to this day is one of the most offensive things in politics today
this man devoted years of his life trying to prove that the leader of our nation was not an american citizen and even after his birth..
hillary is good with connecting with others. she makes people feel like they aren't less superior to her. it's a great strategy.
i'm all for women in leadership, but
you mean like this one?
on my way to a moonlight screening. i'm so shook. i'm ready to cry my eyes out. 😭
"i think i've developed very, very good relationships with the african-american community." ~trump "just listen to what you heard." ~hrc
don't mess with my gurl
when talks abt faith communities, she prbly means mosques. after all the pay her.
one way or another, twitter is going to utterly implode tonight.
turning over to watch the football game.
why didn't you get george bush jr., sr., clinton, reagan to share their birth certificates?
sorry i'll see u soon!!!
14.1 miles team . no time 4 long run on wknd so after a hard day of work. left my troubles on the road. rdy 4 1/2 sat
why are we talking about obama's birth certificate?!?
we’re talking about racial healing “im saying nothing” im still sure his campaign is a punk’d episode
hey you don't know who i'm gonna vote for!
"i'm kind of glad to be canadian right now." - my friend who's watching the debate with me
probably largely the influence of the sanders campaign. her response on crime was surprisingly good.
you'd do it too if you knew all the loop holes. let's be honest here.
argh. agreed, but i'm a dreamer
weez into deep weeds, no cotton, here...nasty
nah, now is the time to troll your friends
he is not answering how he us going to fix anything
isn't this the first day?
drink every time trump sniffles
go fuck yourself, talking about “brave police officers.” cops are filth, all of them.
ism building my own dimensional shifter
if trump is concerned about companies going abroad maybe he should move his plants out of bangladesh where workers are paid 30 cents an hour
hillary is basically saying that all americans are "implicitly racist." that's offensive and is going to hurt her.
trump is rambling; when hillary answers slowly, it conveys steadiness. good for her, bad look for trump.
i agree with - don't vote for .
thanks bro!!
"you know what else i prepared for? i prepared to be president." –
. on and birth certificate: "he should've produced it a long time before." …
are the don's sniffles bothering anybody but me?!! damn dude, take an allergy pill.
i opened a club and i didn’t discriminate against anyone!
not sure..but it should be this fall i would think
hope you are well out there, by the way
wait, wouldn't rent his apartments to african americans in 1973?? 🤔 let me find out!!
hillary needs to interrupt him a bit more. not the way he is interrupting. but she can’t just stand there when he spouts bs.
trump basically admits his company was racist but so were other companies!
our government run by money it don't matter who president we not rich we are going to get screwed regardless 😂 idek why ppl think otherwise
early in this debate, trump had her on defensive. last 35 minutes, he's been on his heels.
mr. sniffy is going to hock some phlegm right across the stage in about 90 seconds here
but it works
trumps law and order and community relations message is way more coherent than hillary's gun control message.
trump has mooooselums in his club... got it!
hillary clinton: "i prepared to be president, and i think that's a good thing"
lester holt just scolded the audience for cheering. they should've held this debate in front of my crowds.
why isn't this debate moderated by ?
i opened a club for everyone in palm beach sniff
just finished my public space opus dropping wednesday. who's winning the debate?
and what did she do? she hired him off the books and sent and received classified information in communications with him.
new theory: trump's babbling rant is actually a sophisticated fuzz-testing suite to test brains for vulnerabilities
my view in spin room media non partisan so far
smh turn it off
i'm really invested in the idiocy now
boiii there is no proof that russia is remotely responsible
i can't wait for the snl skit.
from your own paper...
*sets up catheter to not miss a beat*
"racist birther lie." that's what it is. let's call it what it is. and when people tell you who they are, believe them h/t maya angelou.

pics or it didn't happen 😎
lester is really teeing up a lot of questions and topic that are terrible for trump. even considering his substantial gaps in knowledge.
lol, you were just the latest one, i questions like that all the time and it would take hours to assemble something lol
is the bad man gone from the tv yet?

"you know what else i prepared for? i prepared to be president." -clinton danngg ⚡️
yes yes because your claim of connections is unrefutable 👌👌👌 give me a break
trump answers questions the way i answered essays in college when i didn't study. lots of words to hide the fact that i knew nothing.
i know sweetie. that's why we have booze
want to feel old? this is elton john and kiki dee today.
we are glad to hear she is doing better!

looking forward to tonight's debate knowing that millions of americans will see the i've known for over 40 years.
he was endorsed by isis?
"as far as the cyber" does he have any idea what he is talking about?
this is not looking good. trump is holding it together. hillary feels hesitant
just talking about who is endorsing him and not answering about the cyber attacks.
gay lingo is already annoying as it is. ya bitches be using it in your daily vocabulary as if i understand wtf you saying.
anyone going to interested in meeting up, let me know!
cyberattacks the topics- this is ripe for pvt server pivot from
cyber security! listen up...
nonsense from trump there. he opened a club in palm beach so... he's not racist? or something. after a strong start, he's faltering now.

but he's addressing an actual problem (in this one instant)
i'm a hacker and i do not weigh 400 pounds
so nice tweet it twice
"we should deal with cyberwarfare by having our own home-brew servers." -- hillary clinton, probably
clinton deflects a question about police being implicitly biased against police by saying we all have to struggle with implicit bias
bruh didnt she do that shit last year! when i went over !
ok now drink every time a candidate says "kurds"
times like this i love twitter. whichever side, or top of the fence we're on... we're all here. together.
i have a daughter who's two and so good with computers. and i wouldn't want her to have a president who looks down on women
birtherism is wrapped up in the entire racist legacy of us. they're linked.
trump and this damned water…
donald trump: our cyber is the best. the best. it's so cyber. so cyber. the best. in regards to the cyber, it could also be a 400-pound man.
i made a great sandwich, the most expensive sandwich, and there was no discrimination against muslims involved in that sandwich.
"i was just endorsed by ice" i suspect he meant to say isis - because they are likely rooting for this guy
when broccoli comes on at a party and the white kids start singing "we gone turn this shit to columbine!"
those are some pretty serious problems especially the dog and not having in n out
are you even listening? lol. he won this debate easily. you literally have no clue what your talking about lol.
we need to fix the security of the cyber but it's hard and it's difficult and perhaps not doable but i'm very proud of the property i own.
what's your point
twitter is frozen for me, can't check politifact. grr..
this debate.
both candidates are equally clueless when it comes to "cyber".
he's right tho, i'm really not good at cyber :(
coffee spots to check out in nyc?
clinton: "donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. know what else i prepared for? to be president."
i'm so good with twitter it's unbelievable
make up people did a good job though. he doesn't look like his normal orange self
today is just one of those days
he also hates fat people
i'm watching, but that doesn't mean "the cyber" can't also be the name of a nice new bwick monthly
shit i left my white vans at school.. luckily aint nobody want them ahahahahaha
listen...the way she is looking at him while he's spinning his magical tales of whimsy! 😂 yasss !
wow. trump is defending the russians over hacking the dnc, which american intelligence experts believe was them.
i love blowing this up. i'm not even a strong activist in this lmaooo i'm just getting your 🐐 girl 😂
donald must be very, very smart, because i just can't keep up with him!
listening to talk about isis - note deep inhalation and nose rub (of course,
just think, this is only debate 1 of 4
hillary: *facts facts facts* trump: wrong. it's all words.
i know i'm not the only one who heard trump catch himself by saying " i'm endorsed by is- "
are thou telling me that thyself never hath sniffled
this answer on isis and barron being good at computers and "cyber" is even more incoherent than the norm.
the 400lb guy is going to be sitting in an aeron chair you fat shaming hobgoblin.
the debates! put down the code!
fantasy update: 1 target for julio jones in the first 2 quarters. no catches

who is winning the debate so far?
has he actually answered at least 1 question. i'm not even sure 😂
if donald is unfit to be commander in chief, hillary isn't even an option.
dallas of course stunned by the little shit starting fighting back and picked up the rat and threw it!! ugh
"a very against police judge." a presidential candidate just used that phrase. he has great words.
gaiman also wrote one of my daughter's favorite books! fortunately, the milk by neil gaiman
thoughts on ?
when donald trump goes low, we go high.
i am in the cyber
man i want yo say something funny but this ain't funny man. this shit is not funny at all.

who's winning?
wait so... are there no commercial breaks? i gotta take a meeeaaannn piss
looking how to become more cyber
while you are at it. if you use gmail, get one of these. hacking is just going to get more common.
listening to trump and hilary speak is literally comical. how did we let this shit happen lol
i think it's the largest longest-running military coalition that has existed as a democratic body
i'm not a trump "fan" but hillary is worse (to me). i would have preferred a different candidate but it is what it is.
"i think i’ve developed really great relationships with the african-american community”
stop interrupting. lester where the fuck are you?
craft beer and bbq platform - what's so bad about that???
why does trump speak like how i use to write essays in middle school?...
what is the deal with donald trump and russia?
"take the oil" is literally an insane thing to say. attack him on that. don't appeal to fact-checkers.

its my baby's birthday 🎉 💙 i love you 💋
this is my first and final use of a twitter sticker.
fair enough. i agree it is still up. the fact that he contradicts so often is just striking, yeah?
"accuracy is rare for the " man, trump is a piece of work.
wth is he doing? now is the time for attack trump, but he's spent the last hour defending his old dumbasseries.
bts docu of terry et al making ol. only showing t in silk robe gazing out window w hair done 😀
he is an idiot and egotistical that's why he easily looses this easy debate against because shes opening many possible stumps

there's a moderator at this debate, right?
"why did you push it? why. why you bloated sack of shit answer the question" - the inner monologue of a beleaguered moderator
it's like watching an angry customer and a stubborn manager argue over the fine print of a coupon
the kardashians have no chill.
man the clinch on her cheeks look like she just put 14 sour patch kids in her mouth
he said he had a better temperament than her im deceased
the question of donald trump's taxes came up during . hillary clinton responded. follow our fact check:…
i feel like he has spent a lot of time this debate explaining old crazy shit he did or said while she is just calming blinking at it all
i wasn't gonna drink tonight, but i'm so stressed, confused, angry, and amused.
nothing could sum up my feelings on all this better
"yes i prepared for this debate. and i am prepared to be president." - …
your friends are better off now because of those who voted for president obama in 2008. vote
as soon as i picked up this book i knew i had to buy it. such a crazy energy came over me and i couldn't put it back down.
yeah i won't stop. it's all words
omg, would somebody please call sean hannity?!?!
i didn't expect to even be able to buy it but when it let me i decided what the hell
so great that lester isn't wasting time on trivial issues like immigrants accepting welfare, taking jobs, killing americans.
trump is such a fool and so repetitive.
who knew she had a side eye...
lol, haha, there were over 2500 murders while you were in diapers, you are lost pal.
if you are at your pettiest... its donald trump's level
glass of water no. 8.
, where's the best place to look at you work?
this is bad man. he just gifting the election lol. gonna be nuts
also only asking trump controversial questions....nothing of hillary...always interrupting trump but not hillary
now hillary has both created isis and been fighting it her entire adult life
i've had back injuries i've enjoyed more than this election.
paging khloe's makeup artist, you have competition
okay, i’ll bite, what’s ice?
trump: you stayed home and that's ok. i've been all over. clinton: i prepared to be president and that's a good thi…
lol i miss you, this would be far more entertaining if i was watching this with you
i really like that you're watching the debate and tweeting political things too
: trump: i opposed iraq war. false. he didn’t express opposition until over a year after invasion
your life motto
did just tell a black man "no you're wrong" about racial profiling?oh it's on now.
is drinking clear whiskey? oh no. that's me.
serious question - is this a snl skit being filmed live and we just haven't been let in on the gag yet? or what?
kkk endorses , &amp; saudis pay her, u .
i only read up to golbet of fire (sry) but am pleased that my patronus is a nebelung cat:
trump's rambling and repetitiveness is draining.
clinton disputes trump over his past stances on iraq and libya
i recognize that shoulder shake
i think lester holt should stop this fight. it's getting ugly out there.
if you had howard stern's name being mentioned during the debate in the office pool, congratulations.
if you're seriously voting trump please never speak to me again
. did you call the other day?
beat you to it
what about mrs. hannity?
a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his hands anywhere near the nuclear codes.
lol no he didn't, you read into his statement! saying "because i'm smart" just means he knew and took advantage of irs rules
donald trump says he likes black people and then treats debate moderator lester holt like shit.
bullies are loud, and they never win! ~bm
did they like take it apart?😂 i'm confused
so far both candidates are holding serve with an edge to hillary clinton
when does hillary get a trial for her crimes? :/
a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers near the nuclear codes
this should go without saying: taking nuclear war lightly is disqualifying for anyone seeking to be president of th…

trying to watch the debate, but it is hard for me to listen to trump speak for more than a few seconds.
uh oh. just fatshamed hackers
get him hillary.. donald trump is unfit to run this country !
ahhhh the debates i'm soooo glad i'm not in or from america tbh sorry!
at the edge of north from - where else with a view like this? - sunset beach…
.: "i think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament... i know how to win. [hrc] does not know how to win."
you understand lies?!? i don't! unacceptable for potus to be a solidified liar! dishoesty is not ok in my books!
the way to safer streets is through stronger bonds between police and community – not through hundreds of thousands…
lester holt seems to be cross-examining trump, but not doing the same with hillary...
let's just make her the president already.
so, folks, how much air time do we think is getting over ? how is this a fair moderation?
just curious what the consensus is re: lester holt.
i will stand with police and protect all americans!
have you spoken to the military and our president? how do you know what the military lacks? hes flying at the seat of his pants

[white house, 2018] "president trump, it's up to you to launch the nukes." [trump's hands are too small to turn the keys, earth is saved]
i'm so confused. he is just talking and talking saying nothing omg help it's like having a convo at a party you want to run from!
this debate just gave me the largest headache.
i'm so confused. he is just talking and talking saying nothing omg help it's like having a convo at a party you want to run from!
aww 😢 i hope you feel better soon!
call howard stern too because he is so reputable
he really means "martial law" but hey 😔 rt : what does he mean by "law and order" ? what does law and order entail exactly ?
huffington post: clinton destroys trump on his missing tax returns
my timeline is mocking trump but he’s really holding his own here. he is literally making this shit up on the spot and he’s doing well.
yet somehow, what hrc said as a wife is super important!
if more people knew about the other candidates, they could win easily just because people can't stand clinton or trump.
you mean like an hour ago?
i'm so embarrassed. i'm so scared. i hope hillary really makes a point to reform education b/c the fact that ppl think trump is "smart"
drudge poll has trump winning the debate in a walk. what debate are these people watching?
there are a lot of voters who want to vote for “action”, not “consideration”.
watch for this on both sides. hillary is by no means immune.
she is apologising for him to other countries!!!!!!!! brilliant
my over/under on howard stern mentions was one. feeling confident.
only reason i'm watching the debate at this point is to understand the twitter jokes
"i have a much better temperament than she does." --trump, as he argues with and interrupts lester holt
"he says it's a secret plan but the only secret is he has no plan" - mic drop moment
i just told who i think is winning. cast your vote now!
i think he won, by looking like he could hold his own in a presidential-level debate. this was really depressing
hilary is cool and confident. i must say. he's a bit assaulting. like the street weapons he's ok with.
how the fuck is being rehearsed a sign of weakness? good god at least she says reasonable things. he's rambling because he's clueless.
name calling gets boring.
"cate help i can't stand this"
trump wants more tax breaks for billionaires, won't raise the min. wage &amp; denies climate change. this isn't someone who should be president.
"she doesn't have the look...she doesn't have the stamina." on
all i'm saying is that he could've done so much more for the black community and i don't think he did that.
what song do you think hillary clinton meditates on while trump is speaking
i'll give hillary this, she knows the 1st rule about debating a blowhard. give him enough rope, he'll hang himself. she still stinks corrupt
don't let him change the topic lester.
its wrecked and wont start.. i called so many places and thats the best i could get for it!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥the only secret is that he has no plan🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
new drinking game. take a shot every time trump says "tremendous" or interrupts hilary. you would be shit faced already.
trump is literally rambling and is incoherent
didn't expect this to be a focus point, but hillary on foreign policy sounds crisp, clear and, most importantly, experienced.
this is worse then the debate
math doesnt lie
just an fyi telling me not to criticize a public official is antithetical to my beliefs and principles. never do that to me.
water watch as hillary said, "words matter when you run for president"... trump takes a swig
"when donald trump spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina." —hillary
i think you smoking dust kid
my son is about to graduate from a fine ky college with a comp sci degree. what are the best tech cities going forward? thanks!
yo who's got that gif of hillary's reaction to trump's "temperament"?
donald trump is the just real life manifestation of bobby newport, yes?
she's using your own words in those commercials, trump! your own fucking words.
thank you for the clarification.
trump - you racist, sexist, ignorant ass
trump called a beauty contestant ms. piggy and ms. housekeeping. he did not apologize. that's mildly concerning.
"it's not nice!" trump talks like he's six years old.
if you'd rather sit on your ass in november than go out and vote. don't complain about the result after.
"but it's bad experience" ...that's true imho
add your name now to join the millions of americans who are with hillary all the way to the white house!
trumpty dumpty sat on a wall trumpty dumpty had a great fall all of dad's money and all of dad's men couldn't force mexico to pay for it
however this comes out, i have so little respect for the electorate just that its this close. she's right, she shld be 50 points ahead.
at what point does just stop and say "what the fuck are tou talking aboit you lying sack of shit??!!!"
they better put me on a watch list now
yes, misrepresented stop &amp; frisk case--the judge in sdny who ruled unconst'l was removed by 2nd cir &amp; case is ongoing.

what we have happening right now is a classic michael scott
goodnight, people. that was truly fucked up.
$20 says trump's not doing any further debates. any takers?
you guys look so small and cute lmao
you mean the same laws that let muslims discriminate against gays?
wow. no words. how is this even real?
oh look, a toxic twitter tl. saw that one coming a million miles away.
. closed so strongly. so much for trump's accusation she lacks stamina. trump just collapsed as debate worse on.
thank you so much. the baby is doing better &amp; coach duane is with jesus, so he's doing better too but we sure miss him ...
trump. wearing a tie made in china, just sayin'
ha. is speechless
my head literally hurts listening to this idiot talk.
lmao gotta pick the better piece of shit 😂😂
look, we should all congratulate donald trump for allowing black people into his country club and not calling clinton a c*nt.
can you imagine her handing him his a** ...in chaps 😄😄😄
yeah trump.. we're losing our jobs.. starting with you having your clothing lines manufactured in foreign countries. 👌
nothing on emails. nothing on the corrupt clinton foundation. and nothing on .
//i'm too lax. to put mine back on after i took out my contacts.
girl got stamina she's secretary of frikkin' state
she looks very sleepy.... drugged. eyes sagging, blinking. head bobbing. staring at trump as if in a daze ?
does hillary clinton have what it takes to be president? donald trump doesn't think so.
alice in chains-got me wrong (studio version)
that's a wrap! thanks for joining us and let us know your thoughts. who won ?
the first presidential debate is officially over. who won?
is anyone doing analysis of the candidates' usage of second-person pronouns? i think it might matter.
let the record show that rosie o'donnell's name made it into a u.s. presidential debate. what the fuck, america.
that teixeira stare and bat flip why did no one tell me about it
that was a disaster. 😟
trump walks off stage while clinton stays to shake hands with the crowd.
i'd endure a weekly debate if it meant more baby pics!
me n phil will be together for 6 months this week!!!! it's crazy how time flies n how in love i am
im in tears
nothing on emails. nothing on the corrupt clinton foundation. and nothing on .
. is tough as nails. she put in his place. now let's put her in hers: the white house.
nothing on emails. nothing on the corrupt clinton foundation. and nothing on .
she is much more polished
so at this point i'm pissed so i call seamless and tell them what happened because i'm mad and hungry!!!
where are all the jobs you promised upstate new york? you promised jobs then but never delivered!
my mom jokes about how i'm too poor to buy red hot chili pepper tickets 😭

because i missused the word retarded doesnt make me uneducated
msnbc is reporting that in their opinion hillary has proven her case, she is steady, reliable and has plans. claim trump has no specifics.
good i believe that also..but the part about what party is racist..brainwashed
why is ivanka wearing something low cut?

trump: "if hillary wins, i will absolutely support her." what ?
slightly surprised no mention of benghazi from trump.
it's over. trump, the egoist, the racist, the narcissist, the liar, "won." we all lost. his numbers will go up. she told the truth. so what.
i think you're right.
well i'm pretty sure we have the best bbq. there's that.
tom brokaw said people troubled by black on black crime lmao who he talking about? white people!!!
if you want more likes just tweet something about how the real winner of the debate tonight it twitter
i was going to say something about trump bailing right after this debate but then i remembered he seems to be allergic to em entirely
. &amp; after super predator &amp; obama's racism in 08, not a single black person shld vote 4 hillary
what? other way around
nothing on emails. nothing on the corrupt clinton foundation. and nothing on .
the big shift from tonight will be faded relevance of 3rd party candidates, as undecideds drift to as best of 2 choices.
trump is trash
remember when a five o'clock shadow was the standard for debate-shady?
i found that being somewhat respectful will actually work for him.
i wish she had been more assertive! i think her strategy of letting trump hang himself with his own words (and 👀 at the audience) is…
what? other way around
dear this "debate" is a fiasco. lester holt is just letting the bully talk over hillary and not answer any questions
all i'm saying is hillary is not great. trump is worse but she's not great.
she was very good, so prepared and actually funny. he was incompetent, never replied to questions asked and sniffing no stop.
trump wins!
the nuclear is also tough. (i wouldn't first strike, but i won't take it off the table either). but taking the oil, that's easy.
tonight's debate confirmed this year's election is like picking the best browns quarterback for your fantasy team.
tweet of the year
trump on birther issue: 'i think i did a good job'
.: "everybody would agree that [rosie o'donnell] deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her."…
donald trump did such a phenomenal job. he was strong. he talked about policy. he took hillary down.
it was tough tho lol - i almost gave up.
i ain't making no new music until y'all send me beats
not even close
i love her red suit. shark is out.
point proven😂 my tl consists of "trump's a fool" "trump ain't shit" etc. like no shit got any of ur own opinions ??
i'll offer generous odds to anyone who thinks clinton's polling won't improve over the next week.
lemme guess you got it at occ i had a flat there today 😒
donald has talked more than hillary during this debate.... who do you remember the most? who has been more effective?
wait you have never watched scrubs???
champagne pop is still the best in the game. when will the others ever
not much though. the good secretary didn't have to tonight. les did the debating for her...
can we all take a moment to remember that started under the 🤔
i have to disagree completely w/ . calling a close debate a blowout just wrong
it’s time to call out donald trump for what he is: a compulsive liar, writes.
trump started well with creating jobs and then just lost the plot afterwards
.: “i certainly will support the outcome of this election.”
trump is dodging the question on whether he'll accept the outcome of the election
what are your favorite classic characters to dress up as in october? if you're bald, man, the…
"that was a very against police judge"
no, he didn't. he said he was gonna punch him in the mouth.
hillary is a crook
trump : i was just endorsed by is.... is?
well, i'm happy that you found a candidate that represents you!
lester holt is asking trump tough questions cable/network interviewers have declined to ask him in lower-stakes settings. some bravery.
hillary clinton and donald trump discussing foreign allies and policy now
former top kasich aide:
well, i'm happy that you found a candidate that represents you!
i think don not only went off the rails, but might have been snorting them as well. [sniffle sniffle].
prayers for anyone living in the santa cruz mtns, major fire there going on right now! can see the smoke from wind…
all talk and no pay member, bishop. lol
strong debate for hillary. way stronger than her primary debates vs bernie.
lester holt is letting them both talk too long.
add your name now to join the millions of americans who are with hillary all the way to the white house!
hey twitter followers, i apologize for the fury of debate tweets. i just like the planet we live on and want to keep it.
drives me crazy when companies hit you up incessantly for a review/feedback on a transaction. i don't owe you that. don't junk up my inbox.
hillary was consistently calm and controlled throughout which was very presidential. one could say she had a better temperament
hillary clinton has mastered the "woman listening" face
nyle. what???
i'm not defending him. i said he didn't push her on anything. i'd rather the hc won in a fair debate.
my favorite part of the debate was when i turned it off eight minutes in and listened to instead. easier for faint of heart.
shoutout to for getting me hip to discord..... go give her a follow
woah! where'd you run into him?
thank you lol
kennedy from mtv 1991 is giving a cutting analysis on fox that it's a "draw".

i take advantage of the laws of the nation for my own profit. that was trumps answer
you can have a "liberal" bias and also be totally sexist without realizing it.
but he didn't say the union. he said
she did address the emails, and said "it was a mistake and i take responsibility for that."
the arrogance of this man is stunning in its brazenness, and sad in its utter lack of humanity.
.: exposed trump's lack of preparation, but clinton seemed over-prepared at times.
so your counter argument is that i have less money than you?
trump won the debate tonight.
i can 103% guarantee not a single republican who went into this debate a trump supporter will come out of it not a trump supporter.
i've really enjoyed blocking all the racist/misogynist/just plain rude people who have been tweeting obscenties at me tonight.
you've got to hand it to hillary clinton. for a woman with brain damage, blood clots, dehydration, pollen problems she is as tough as nails.
absolutely will always be. fact check on your facebook see how many friends like trumps page. compared to hillary
i guess no one really knows right?
then i've only had like 2 real girlfriends 😭😂
you know you have to pay royalties for this tweet right?

there is no violation of the sanctity of the voting booth nice sound bite but not factual
wait. she did not run ads that say mean things. she ran ads that use audio of his own mean nasty statements.
oh snap cnn just played the wolf blitzer cnn thing and trump lied.
pretty damn happy to see tom brokaw behind the wheel again, though.

haven't seen any trump fans defending him on my twitter. maybe because they literally can't anymore. hil is killing it.
…meanwhile, trump's answer to the final question did not connect.
my guess is they are ecstatic in brooklyn.
heck of a job, gop primary voters.
looked more intently at the tv for post debate than i did at any point during the debate
got home just in time to see the end of the mets game and see the amazing tribute to jose and the replay of dee gordon's home run 😭
im still trying to figure out how we went from talking about nukes to rosie odonnell.
women in america remember this when you cast your vote. 🇺🇸 …
hillary clinton is definitely better at delivering smug, self-satisfied lines. i'll bet she practices them in front of the mirror.
fellow watchers, did donald trump actually say that global warming is a chinese hoax?
why even consider it an option? both are threats undoubtedly and yes meredith i agree with you

i was upset that i didn't get to watch the debate exactly when it started but now all i'm hearing is nonsense. should have known..
regardless of who wins the presidency, defenders of liberty will be needed to disregard party boundaries &amp; to stand up for the constitution
poor came so close to actually moderating this "debate." not that i expected him to, but i'm still disappointed.
yep and no one had the courage to turn around and say: shut up or get out!
the concept of global warming was created by and for the chinese in order to make u.s. manufacturing non-competitive.
the candidate is alarming but a lot of his ideas are what we've heard from the gop up and down the ballot for years
dis biiiish needs to take her lying shady ass bullshit &amp; move along ✌🏽️
i don't know what's more painful, tonight's debate or the "we should hang out more!" conversation happening less than five feet away.
liberals see this expression as kick ass and dont get how mirthful and entitled she looks 2 everyone else. #
post debate poll. who wore it better? rt for teletubby poe, like for
marlins 7, mets 3. the score barely mattered.
trump won on trade, police, taxes, regulation, change. hillary won on tax returns, birtherism, trump's background, nato.
yes! bourbon!
cnn during debate: 2 people talking over each other for 90 minutes. cnn after debate: 9 people talking over each other for 90 minutes.
sent a pre opened product and now my shelf is missing all the screws. i better not have to lug this back to…
ahh got it. so donald not an idiot (err, in that case).
hillary supporting drone strikes in my country is why she will never have my vote
trump just told msnbc reporter he never said during debate it was smart he didn't pay federal taxes. everything is awesome.
that bad eh? tbh i'm not a fan of either candidate. i was a bernie man!

if only television mattered ...
now on : trump super surrogate joins us live.
i hope you can't vote
here's a key thing, when you pull back. so far, clinton has played more offense than defense, trump more defense than offense.
ok. this debate. in three words. go.
.: exposed trump's lack of preparation, but clinton seemed over-prepared at times.
i don't know, i don't feel any different, still both suck!! more please!
hahaha yes! it was amazing. almost as good as when he didn't cite his $694 million income in a braggadocios way
then why are you in my mentions?
at least trump didn't talk about his dick tonight.
oh go fuck yourself with that bullshit
no, you said "look," donald, and i'm pretty sure by "look" you meant "penis."
trump compares u.s. airports to 'third world country'
"rehearsed" is different from "over-prepared." some ammo was obviously already loaded in the chamber. she let it fl…

like sooo funny!! 🙊🙊 ok what did you all think about the debate tonight? …
it is really scary! i always have to look cause it could be either!
lol i showed this song 😂
not sure why they even have all these initiatives. seems like people just vote yes for things that cost money, and vote no for funding them.
"mrs. clinton" ? go home.
i'm just going by "friends" posts. i.e. hillbillies i went to school with.
hillary clinton was steady and articulate tonight. donald trump was just the opposite. she won big -- even bigger...
hold that l
stop and frisk was early 80's modeled for mass incarceration of blacks as the crack era exploded.
no, it didn't.
trump squinted, clinton laughed and the rest of america cried. desperately. at the hole they dug for themselves.
my entire feed is hillary and donald face swaps. i never thought i'd say this but... i miss the engagements and baby pictures
bull crap - pseudo intellectual elites on a socialist power grab are the greatest danger !!!
when donald trump says he has a "winning temperament."
all the men, all the times.
mine came after they got eliminated lmaoo i still wear it
are these the ads that literally use his own words?
when trump yells "facts" ()
who won the first presidential debate? here's what one focus group in pennsylvania thinks:
update: this did not work.
new game: drink every time donny says 'all these other countries' because he can't give specifics
pro tip---turning off the cable tv and reading smart beat reporters/columnists analysis &amp; comments on twitter is much more informative
they're both making my head hurt
you know what i think you're the asshole
if you actually think he won that debate you're crazy... lol

every country should have nukes so the us can’t fuck with them. anti-proliferation is pro-imperialism.
hit me with a grade for raw, please.
the debate lacked specifics , had a lot personal attacks, i bet undecided voters werent swayed either way
this is honestly one of the best responses to anything debate-related. so simple. so pure.
she burped him, she wiped his .ss, then helped him blow his nose. full service! better than a trump dump.
"how'd it go?" "i didn't bring up her husband's infidelity." *kellyanne gives him a liver treat* "good boy!"
chris christie, on msnbc, just said that we shouldn't believe fact-checkers, because "they have an agenda." yes. it is to check facts, dude.
i am the only candidate who will cancel for 43 million americans locked in debt.
i was mia for the last hour, because twitter had me in twitmo. i've been spitting mad at holt's bias. it's disgusting.
well if you think so.
did you watch ash vs evil?..new season starts sunday
well, good. now i can add you to the list of people to blame if trump wins. hope your little protest works out for you all.
oops, my bad. i did mean that.
youre a great boss!
when will you be back at old slip, we miss you!
really theres so much evidence about all those accusations to hillary yet youre listening to mainstream media who owns her
hillary is dead wrong about iran. too bad donald is incoherent on the subject.
i used to think about immature things you know like do you love me? do you want me?
oh my god even the ones from smash👌🏾👌🏾?
how long before this tweet is deleted?
you right ma
you should not be proud. unless you think ravenclaws are preprogrammed robots. her performance felt robotic
i think you should take your own advice and delete your account 😂😂😂
does trump know what he calls a modest loan is an amount that more than one generation of my family could live comfortably on?

i want curl up in a corner and never move again
twitter had a few things to say in response to 's comment about minorities "living in hell:"
it's not true. buzzfeed fact checked this already.
it’s crazy. who are the debates even for? was anyone watching not already certain who they’d be voting for?
oh for fuck's sake i accidentally recorded the fox news broadcast. welp...
oh man i'm sure of both
3 days guys omg what the fuck is life
there is nothing wrong w/ feeling displeased w/ both of the remaining candidates &amp; abstaining. when we stand they lose
when all you want to do is joke about the debate but your husband wants to actually hear the candidates
which means we have two candidates that don't fundamentally get the internet/tech in general. a very dangerous precedent.
again no mention of in the . at some point living with autism need answers.
the "lesser of two evils" argument is not one i want to make when voting for the leader of our nation. besides, evil is evil.
first sea of trees now this
rather than hillary's america, we need to take a different path
you pay more in taxes than .
what facts? seriously want to know
too dang hot in san francisco today. saw a mirage that looked like donald trump on my tv trying to become our next president.
didn't you overcharge millions of dying people for a drug so that you could profit personally?
you've got to hand it to trump (by )
my mom nailed it tonight! if you agree, make sure you're ready to vote on november 8:
everyone, they didn't cause it, america did. we aren't america if you think about it. the government is america
would have learned more about the candidates that way in silence lol
there still is hope. let me in the second debate.
i was hacked
you've got to hand it to trump (by )
trump "i've developed good relationship with the african-american community" he's polling at one percent with black voters
. just told me he did not bring up record with women because was in room.
i just bought aguilla in .22lr just haven't used it. was told its quality but don't know for sure.
“i think donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. … i prepared to be president.” - hillary clinton
clinton said 4839 words, while trump said 4452. kind of surprised with how much he was being an interrupting mansplainer.
donald trump is now doing an interview saying in the next debate he's going to talk about the indiscretions of bill clinton. real life.
dear donald trump not 👏🏾 all 👏🏾 black 👏🏾 people 👏🏾 live 👏🏾 in 👏🏾 inner 👏🏾 cities 👏🏾
lots of y'all have asked what my modified lamborghini sounds like... here is a video — sounds way better in person 😈
maybe im missing it but "she later adopted that child and named him hope" sounds like she did? but this is the internet..
still too hot 😓 i guess i'll be online a lot later than usual
well i can agree with you that both of these nominees are bozos.
is there anything better than someone who just gets you.
its all in the articulation. i m sure they came up with some trumped up suspicion.
maybe im missing it but "she later adopted that child and named him hope" sounds like she did? but this is the internet..
also, my take. he is woefully ignorant. he has two issues extorting money from allies, &amp; stop &amp; frisk. both are ser…
😩 tara wanna go out friday but i'd rather be working.... 🤑🤑
donald trump's voice was shrill and his face tired. he should've worn brighter colors, had a softer haircut and smiled more.
&lt;&lt;&lt; first election as a u.s. citizen 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
tonight hrc only needed one argument: "just listen to what you heard"
anyone still torn about who they're voting for in this election either won't be affected by trump's madness, or thinks they won't.
i hope more players poured some more shit on tito in the clubhouse
i won’t lie i don’t get the love for it. i’ll watch it most likely but i feel the dc shows are so weak. controversially..
black folks, everyone, when trump talks law &amp; order &amp; giuliani, remember the sodomizing of abner louima.
clinton campaign chair on trump: "he dug himself deeper by repeating untruths and falsehoods"
post-debate is also an excellent time for banh-mi.
fact check: trump is telling perhaps the biggest lie of all right now, that he always opposed the invasion of iraq
is this a real quote???
call it what it is; rape &amp; pedophilia.
i try like hate the kardashians. i do not care.
very true but think about it. the other candidates only have about a 9% chance. not enough people know about
nate thurmond
someone asked me this tonight &amp; now i must know this about all of my friends
if you having a bad day remember at least you not a saints fan
was nice to see the 2 candidates agreeing on certain issues, especially some concerning safety of citizens. this is good!! yay!
nah, man i made that up.
i sincerely doubt trump understands what the role of secretary of state is.
missed this: trump snubbed moderator holt after the debate. a poor loser move. ht
every time was passed another sign for the taxi stand, he would lose is mind and scream and say how "its bullshit i have to walk so far!"
cruz: "trump had his strongest debate performance of the election cycle"
do the damned math... end of story
only took till the 3rd quarter
no matter who wins this debate or the election. america loses.
can't believe that there was no question about the clinton foundation!
looking at twitter, it seems the only unifying opinion in america is that laguardia is a dumpster fire of an airport. from this, we build.
the 52.5 second buffer on the side to encode the live video stream and optimize it is probably a good balance for hd video, too. ⚖️

well you're super nice to me! any reason why?
can we do this
it's way hotter than last night, right?
ooooh rose &amp; ten forever! copyright donna noble!
best pieces will be sold out by tonight. don't sleep
stop &amp; frisk brought the murder rate, shootings, violent assaults, rapes to record low #'s lol this is the 1&gt;
trump: "that is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her...." holt: "the record shows otherwise."
trump says he got obama to release birth certificate, and clinton did not “because she can’t bring it home.”
we have to do another 😏😂
i would've known bc ur the only one who still uses lol
most clinton supporters are just anti-trump, &amp; most trump backers are just anti-clinton. you have better choices.
you can also get the video on cb or purchase it with an amazon gc just send me an mail! princessraiiny.com
glad hrc is calling trump out on his demeaning &amp; degrading comments about women. its not about the stamina but the decency to be president.
was disheartening to hear him argue against facts (such as stop and frisk=unconstitutional) but it happened less often than usual so 👍🏼
i'm looking for a new bank, preferably one with good international support... what do you all recommend?
mary cracking her voice singing to hillary legit made me laugh out loud. wow....

how about this weekend when you guys visit 😏😏😏
tru that. have a great life, and i hope that whomever wins that they do a good job for the country
hillary clinton: "i prepared to be president, and i think that's a good thing"
i will never endorse him or even think he should be a legitimate candidate for this office but he showed improvement tonight
(also that i'm in an echo chamber that i'll never escape)
.: exposed trump's lack of preparation, but clinton seemed over-prepared at times.
i hope the book shows the "normal" male and not the surgically altered - yeah i'm an intactivist in case you didn't know! 😜
alright peeps.....who do y'all have winning the debate tonight? and why? i'll be looking for y'all response!
mediocrity ?
agree. post matters more. so you are trying to twist the story to be something it wasn't? he lost. badly.
hilary: "trump payed zero federal income tax" trump "that's because i'm really smart." wow.
the internet is undefeated
can we have some factchecking?! stop and frisk did not reduce crime. no one is going to your website, hillary, say it now! you too lester!
you pay more in taxes than .
this is all i needed to see
did it actually hit you?? i didn't see it at that exact moment, i just looked over and saw you, it looked like a close call.
why are you scared?

i realize he was trying to say ice, but it really sounded like he was endorsed by isis.
it was everything
it could grow back. or we could use a dull prop razor
i missed it on purpose, but i'm cracking up because my buddy just told me trump's debate performance = tomsula's intro presser.
either work to make gradle the defacto build system for play; or work to make sbt builds faster. that way, everyone wins.
rep. collins also insisted that hillary didn't seem "human" when she didn't interrupt. i asked if he's familiar with the rope-a-dope.

looks like pregnant kerry has more stamina than trump. sad!
only criticism of hillary is that she didn't mention trump's "wages are too high" line and his making his stuff overseas.she will next time.

dae ho lee about to run into one right here.
at this point i think these are our best options: 1) give barack a third term 2) have michelle obama be president 3) bring back bernie
what? you have a kickstarter? why didn't you tell anyone?
i thought the debate was sprightly. hillary was more on point, but i don't think it changed any voters' minds.
